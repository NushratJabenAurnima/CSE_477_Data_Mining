ngl this was just a giant twilio advertisement
are you mr beasts39 father lol why do you look like you could be his father you even sound like him at times
i would like to reach out to you i have been brainstorming about white labeling a already developed app and not quite sure how to do this can we have a conversation look me up on google flex transportation services llc out of waukesha wi thank you
bro looks like old version of jimmy
bruh for real
great but the dad jokes and faff is really annoying learning is not about unnecessary distractions
good tut but it is very hard to follow the spotify developer is totally different right now92025 that is presented and even for twilio you need to provide your phone number and whole bunch of personal data it took instructor to setup twilio on this video almost 10 minutes

definitely craig is the best i just had the opportunity to see this video and i am totally engaging in apis
i understand theory part but i don39t understand what are you doing
dont worry if you are a beginner it is expected that you wont understand the coding part
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt137217a quotso now i have copypastaquot
those who have stuck with thunderclient can use echoapi
collections are not available on the free version of thunder client
i am not getting any of it is it a normal syndrome
api is not a beginner level topic you have to have a lot of background knowledge its ok
avichiii
i am not able to find spotify gt console does it still exist
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt530850a a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt8071327a
is there any prerequisite required for learning this course the educator
ohh yes a lot he will say you dont need any prior knowledge but you do
jus started learning about api39s i can39t spot the curl request on my spotify consoleurs seemed to be at the topbut mine isn39t althoughi am using my android device for this so i39m guessing the layout must be differentany advice
found it
but after i copy the curl thing and paste it in the terminalit returns status401 message invalid access token  what can i do
i tried the getrequest on my terminal they all came back as statusfailedwhat do i do
do i need the 39messangerservicesidtoken39 for this
are you using cmd by any chance
best lecture but too many ads
unecessarily long video
i don39t know anything about api does this course cover everything about rest apis
no you need to refer other resources
i can39t get access it39 say 401 and invalid token feel stuck if anyone wants to help
i had the same problem turns out you can39t simply click the quotget tokenquot button and select your scopes anymore for example at the minute a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt21263526a you can see something like quotuserreadplaybackstatequot in the checkbox options which you would need to select if you wanted to play a song for example you need to do this the manual waybrbrimportant advice copy paste this into chatgpt or claude and they will guide youbrin more detail if you need to also these commands work in windows but if you39re using mac or linuxbryou need to ask an ai to rewrite the curl command so that they work on your current osbrbrhere39s how to actually get a user access token with scopesbryou39ll need to do the authorization code flow manually here39s the stepbystepbrbrcreate the authorization url replace yourclientidbrbra hrefhttpsaccountsspotifycomauthorizeresponsetypecodeampclientidyourclientidampscopeuserreadplaybackstate20usermodifyplaybackstateampredirecturihttplocalhost3000callbackampshowdialogtruehttpsaccountsspotifycomauthorizeresponsetypecodeampclientidyourclientidampscopeuserreadplaybackstate20usermodifyplaybackstateampredirecturihttplocalhost3000callbackampshowdialogtrueabrbrvisit that url in your browser  you39ll be asked to log in and authorize your appbryou39ll be redirected to something likebrbrhttplocalhost3000callbackcodeaqc4o2vudeomdopdubhbrbrcopy the code parameter from that urlbrexchange it for an access tokenbrbrbashcurl x post quota hrefhttpsaccountsspotifycomapitokenhttpsaccountsspotifycomapitokenaquot brh quotcontenttype applicationxwwwformurlencodedquot brd quotgranttypeauthorizationcodeampcodeyourcodeampredirecturihttplocalhost3000callbackquot bru quotyourclientidyourclientsecretquotbrbrthe response will include your accesstoken with the proper scopesbrif you get the quotinvalid redirect uriquot error means the redirect uri you39re using in the authorization url doesn39t match what39s configured in your spotify app settings
thank you for empathizing with your learners it feels like i39m listening to my best friend talk
honored to be your api bff
i hate i hate i absolutely hate watching long boring educational videos but you39re such a fun educator it didn39t even felt like a lecture i39m so into watching the entire course
that was a rollercoaster of a review
craigsdennishaha
awesome
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt575213552a i39m a bit confused what does the query do and what needs to go in the body
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt69109a why do you have twilioauthtoken to be spotify api token aren39t those two unrelated apis
this course will help me for qa role
thank you stranger for making this helpful video i appreciate it
thank you stranger for the comment
buddy made a pp joke in the middle of this session
agreedhe is one of the best educators on the web
thank you
except for the great content i really do appreciate your sense of humor
mr beast from coding background
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt7921312a by this time i was already overloaded with info and listening at 075 speedbri really love his style of teaching its so fun and absorbable into my dense brain
guys are you facing the same problem on twilio i couldn39t find the message resource
naaahdis mr beast older brothermr beastier
i was in a coffee shop while saying quotpquot
he looks like mrbeast if you notice carefully
hi i want to learn about apis but i want to know a learning path before i start the video which path should i take
look at me im relatable pleasei just want to learn about apis
great stuff but the problem is i understand but when i see and code its fine otherwise blankany suggestions
bro this is a huge help  i am watching this to learn about apis as a beginner developer
hi craigbrhow did you send a message that you are referring at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt932323523abrplease assist thank you
also lesson has an impressive api to interact with students thanks guys it best of all i have ever learn
he39s fairly annoying
spotify docs changes twilio docs changed thunder client is now behind a paywall but it39s still good to learn the theory of api rest and the pace of the course with pauses is great just sit back and watch
yeah couldn39t complete any of the demos more or less but it39s still a good vid
such a lovely teacher lt3
peace thank you
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt9401540a ada indonesia bjir
thanks very much for the videos really insightful brbut from security perspective i will just say when your editing the video you can just blur any sensitive information
thank you mr beast of development
i thumbed through the project in the last hour of this video  i noticed it involved twilio  i39m at my wits end with twilio  i can39t get the phone number verified  i signed up 20 days ago and i have tried 3 times to verify that number  in the second time over two weeks went by before they rejected my verification  there is no help and there is no way to contact twilio
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt8401400a
im sorry i didnt understand how to use an api other than twiliosomething in general
this explanation is pretty good
please i need help with the teachers note the link isn39t working
i kind of focused in on the spotify apis  i have spent some time with them  i was having some trouble with curl  after long discussions with chatgpt i decided to use request in python on my jupyter notebook  is this the same as using curl  in any case i haven39t even looked at postman yet
in a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt6211021a why is the upper function in python used for making all characters in a string uppercase called the api
all agree with some of these comments  we are not getting enough information  i39ve just spent over an hour trying to figure out how request a token on spotify  at least on my spotify there is no quotrequest tokenquot button  i finally got a token but i had to go through chatgpt and write a python code just to get one
you could have gotten the token directly from your terminal tho
man you have no idea how right you were at least i kinda got practice while trying to figure it out took like a hr
hoopernamedbran3875 laughinghave you tried to go to the twilio account yet  at least with spotify there was a work around  at least for me twilio was a lot worse  but the big problem here this is suppose to be a video to learn about apis  i39ve spent way more time jumping through the various hoops with spotify and twilio just to get the tools that this guy requires
larryhatcher8927 yeah i couldn39t figure out how to refresh my token for spotify i39m gonna just watch it through at this point and then hop on to another tutorial
at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt456311603a at quotherequot what and where is he using opening
to many information make it simplier dudesorry but dislike
i woke up to this wow
i was pretty much keeping up then we got to twilio  i created an account created a phone number  then i tried to verify the number  i kept getting a popup asking for a business name and url  i never got pass that
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt46046a
he will tell you what needs to be done but will never tell you how to do it buddy what was the purpose of this video
mr beast39s  a programmer in an alternate universe
i have to go back through unit 1 a few times take naps and then come back again i understand it overall but don39t know how it works
best citation ever at min a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt22213701abrlove u bro i mean big poppa
one of the best videos on api and explainationbrbrthe teacher is an absolute master of the craftbrwhat all videostopics has he taught here or anywhere elsebri would love to understand topics from him
is this an ad for trillio  a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujge8mfy5u7jpsxknap95gamaea
quotshe would take that api dev to red lobsterquot
mrbeast be working too hard these days
to be honest started off well but how the extension and the app works is poorly explained
idk if its just me but why he look like mr beast
great content also you have quite a good resembelence with rick of pawn stars
best chanel ever
i was always running away from apis but looking at this video and how easy you have made this for everyone is outstansding  thank you
me too same thought
i can39t find the spotify console anywhere their website looks to havebeen completely revamped is there a help page for that
the console is at the bottom of the page
didnt find it either
hah mrbeast what are you doing here
i can39t unsee it now
i like his shirt
so interesting personality wao really was so confused about api but mr api is next level
quotintresting dataquot i see what you did there
hello guys was anyone able to access the teachers notethe link is not working here
the link still works for me but now it says quotthis repository was archived by the owner on may 13 2025 it is now readonlyquot
kennethphotography is it working for you now
emmanuelgrant312 yes still loads for me with the message about it being archived and readonly
really nice thanks for sharing this course a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgrocketredcountdownliftoffa
we should use the 39faux api39 platform to create free unlimited storage and apis
if anybody watching  in feb 2025 brand stuck on  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt23463906a on spotify dev mode  oauth missing brbr1 you don39t need to generate o auth  the api create auth token itself  bryou need to input only  q and type brbr2  if any body stuck 401 error 49 07br first create mobile app from spotify developer dashboard br second you can use postman to get bearer token brbr it helps me in first two step bra hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvn34bm2cu3ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvn34bm2cu3gampt996sabrbr now you can copy token bearer paste in curl br i am using window power shell for command brbrbut the output format is really bad format  you can try another sources except command worst for mutiline
thanks a lotbrbrsth i want to add to thisbrwe can use git bash too
the course is good but you should go straight on pointstoo much useless bla bla bla
i have a better name for it  i call it bullshit  also  both spotify and twilio gave me a ton of problems  this course is outdated and strays off course on almost every point
where do u find the notes of this video that is discussed in the first few minutes of this video
love this tutorial but i can access the notes
i cannot find the console tab on spotify for developerswhat may i be doing wrong
same here if you found so please put it down here it will be helpful
mohamedshakeel146 they combined console with the documentation
waste of my time at 44 min he says hes using mac and he does no know windows wow
this is one of the best educators on the web  he doesnt put me to sleep and actually makes sense
thank you so much
hy folks it39s true he is veritasium39s elder brother
unfortunately twilio has massively downgraded their documentation  it looks so nice and easy to use on the video but now it is not user friendly especally for beginners who would be the first ones to use it a real shame
yeah it seems like most of the stuff that he talks about twilio api collections at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt626314423a is now gone or at least set to private
i got an error message code21608 even though my number is verified is it possible its cos its a nigerian number i rechecked and its verified on twilio
this is really the best video to watch to understand api39s properly so well done and easy to follow

i am exploring back end and i have used the api many times but still couldnt get the accurate grasp of it which overwhelms me and i just have started this video and the amount of work that has been done in this video is outstandingits friendly interactive and he explains in grass root which is my preferences to learn evrerthing thanks to this channel and instructor
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt8301350a
more than an api course this course feels like a deep dive into the twilio website
great
i am not able to send messages  to my twilio phone number using my indian contact no  has anybody faced the same issue if yes how did u resolve it
thank you very much sir it really helped me a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgm8mfy4jbfswjhl0pyoua2akaa hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgm8mfy4jbfswjhl0pyoua2akaa hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgm8mfy4jbfswjhl0pyoua2akaa hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgm8mfy4jbfswjhl0pyoua2aka merci beaucoup
this is the best api course which i have found in this globe  my only request will be have a much more interactive thumbnail i had this video in my feed for around a year or two but for some reason ibr didn39t click on it to watch it oh wait ibr know the reason it is simply because i didn39t find the thumbnailbr appealing i39m just giving mybr opinion here and the best thing which ibr learnt apart from api is don39t judgebr a book by it39s cover or neverthelessbr a video by it39s thumbnail  bybr the way a heartfelt shoutout to thebr instructor who made this course in sobr much interactive and fun manner
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt935523555a how did he sent the message  through the sms or what
same i also want to know that i am not able to send message as  these are us based nos and my verified no is 91 india
bro i am also stuck in that if anyone knows the answer please let me know
wheres the link to the tutorial explaining how to make my own api
truly amazing it was truly amazing take a break and enjoy rest
thank you for the tutorial but the teaching notes are not accessible the links are not working
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt33615601a that was a horrible joke
wth the ads are getting long and cant skip them
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt560920a
the best way to understand the apis is to talk about the windows apisbrif i make a desktop application in which the user will open files save or save asand print or sharebrit will be insane to write into my application all the code needed to make new application quotcommon user dialogue interfacesquot that opens or saves as or printsor sharesbrwhy should i do that while windows provides small programs and routines and common dialogue boxes that can do all thatbrand all i have to do is to summon them from windows system brone to open any filean other to save as and choose the output extensionan other to open the print page or share or copy pastebrit wood be insane to rewrite similar quottoolsquot or quotroutinesquot or name39em what ever you want they39re just simple quotapisquotbrthey are programs that windows provides for himself first and for all any other tiers or user39s programmed apps to make life more easy for allbrand those are just a few samples from a long list of apis that windows and tiers offer like a drop of water from a big ocean
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt4049010729a
this guy is the best tutor ever we need more tutors like this
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt10801800a
you should really change the title of this video and add quotfor mac osquot because it39s not really for beginners if you39re using windows i managed to get most of the thing you did to work but it did take quite a bit of googling and doing extra thing that are not mentioned in the notes many people would just give up and watch something else as it does take time to make this work on windows and it take away from the learning flow
you only needed to know how to set up your terminal if you aren39t willing to research that on your on then being a developer is not for you
thanks
oh well well that was fun
the introduction is too long he just talks and talks about so many issues does not go into the concept of the course
why does this dude looks like me beast
same bri39m currently watching dark2017brcan39t help but think he39s mr beast himself from the future lol
i love the way you talk to me makes me feel like i understood it did i
this is my first foray into api programming the expected changes to spotify mentioned early in the video are quite apparent as are considerable changes in twilio making the training difficult to follow i39m constantly having to pause the training to dig through the website to locate the relevant pages in order to follow the training path the information contained is very thorough and appreciated but it definitely needs a complete update
excellent introduction to apis
pause again a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt585913739a
the feelings of this training is more and over bri really enjoyed watching it
today39s lesson brought to you by spotify
terima kasih
informative
i39m sorry craig but this needs a 2024 version from the for developers page update
spotify doesnt have the console in this verson quotat a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt23333853a how do i use the commandsquot
you don39t just watch that part or you can skip to twillio if u want
it doesnt have console but you can get the same functionality in search but still  spotify isnt giving authorization bearer token  so got stuck at that point

he39s the david j milan of apis
apibritapiapi
also in the course of learning it39s a good idea to watch the video multiple times i39ll usually start each learning session with rewatching what i39ve learned the day before not only does it help for the knowledge to sink in but you pick up the bits you didn39t pick up the first time and sometimes a single word or sentence repeated is enough to commit something to memory for life i39m 54 years old and have been a systems engineer my whole life and have interacted with many api39s including the twitter api the wordpress api various gaming api39s i watch this sort of thing fairly regularly as computing is a fast moving field with many concepts learned either fading out with time or replaced by newer technology this is super important if you are currently working to keep abreast of emerging technologies you may need for upcoming projects or jobs

another great video azul  were also very keen to see what happens from outside the usa  some great points made  its important to have a long term perspective

you have just gained a full regiment of followers bri put my phone down still playing because i was afraid that i wouldnt be able to find the video again group of recruits were listening and i must say very politely asked if i could quotairdrop the video to the classquot brbri can hear them listening to it in the dorm right now

ayo mrbeast
all for oneone for all nice project
personally after completing the whole course i won39t suggest this course to anyone who wants to learn about apis seriously it felt more like explanation of various api tools from the second chapter rather than actual api related knowledgebrbrit is still a good course with a practical approach in explanation and can be taken if a fun way of learning things is your style but not for when you need immediate information or binge learning
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt20973457a should we thank her first
can we get a david attenborough style tutorial
excellent introduction of api absolutely  the way it was taught
this course is quite good however it woul39ve been better if it was focused for people who already know how to code because who the hell would try to learn apis without coding knowledge

thanks alot
spotify isn39t a good example because it isn39t available in my current regionbrtelegram bot apis would be a better example
this tutorial is exactly what i needed everything is explained so clearly even for a beginner like mei39ve watched several api tutorials but this one breaks it down in the most understandable way such a wellstructured course you made apis seem a lot less intimidating than i thought

hello i39m on the spotify website and it39s difficult to follow along because the ui change is much less visual and literally things are not at the same places i can adapt i just wanted to voice the difficulty as i might not be alone i know it39s frustrating to have a video you post hit so differently already the next year
are you mr beast uncle
his positive attitude is making me upset brim going to go watch 3 hours of louis rossman to balance it out jk this was a great video
what i dont understand is at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt786021100a or at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt732020200a how you would know that you can even use msid or remove do you have to look at the object you get when you consolelog to see that
when i try to post the sms at around thea hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt70110a mark i get from curl quoterror 3 port number was not a decimal number between 0 and 65535quot any ideas why

why would you make such a big deal about inclusivity and then go call mr knowlescarter by his former name not cool big poppa you should know he hates that because how it went with his id pick a message i39m not just quoting his majesty boyd g39s new single secondnewest whatever same thing
if it39s quothelpfulquot to know intro coding and quothelpfulquot to know how the web interface works then i would remove the word quotbeginnerquot from the title
it39s begginer for starting on api39s of course you need to know the most basic stuff about it
you man just wanted to say that you are very cool at explaining this stuff

here to add comment since not anything in recent  in this dry api you try to use as much jokes you could use to make it more interesting for us to learn  thanks for making this video for us with tremendous effort
idk if theres anyone who learned photoshop or graphic design online as well but craig is the deke of software development
who is with me he is looking like a mrbeast
i lost it when you said quotwho runs the terminal curlquot lol
update this using a different api maybe obsidian api

excellent tutor
quotgive yourself some patiencequot
as of right now if you try to do the little trick with the alias on the email spotify sees right through it and if you already have an account with that base email it will not let you create a new account
i would also for sure search for beyonce
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt29114831a i didn39t install  curl on windows 11 but when i type curl followed by the uri then i39m getting the complete response like the status code content in html raw content etc did anyone else tried the same
worst course on apis
why
sir it39s a big boned arrow  or an arrow function
i39m getting an error message every time i try to copy a multiple line command into the terminal i tried pasting it line by line but then the command doesn39t runs into an error not sure what to do with this
dude you are the perfect instructor
best api course ever really enjoyed the manner of craig
this video does a good job of answering questions i had roughly the same time i had them thats a tough tightrope to walk as an instructor and i really appreciated the consistency with which it happened brbri researched the google trick and immediately got suspicious when he showed that we can essentially create bot accounts and each one gets 15 its nice when a person you can39t ask questions of consistently answers them anyway
when i am in twilio i cant get in the twilio docs sms page it always ask for log in but after i log in again the twilio docs page ask for log in again
i39m just starting with backend developing and this helped me a lot thank you
anyone else having trouble with the pictures showing on the website
yup

not recommended it39s outdated and not even supported notes after completing of a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt540013000a minutes don39t watch it please
are u mrbeast related u sound same and looked same as him lmao
stop
twilio and spotify portion of this does not work
you got to love his great sense humor
you finished the course

why did u stop bro
great vid love it i am having difficulty with all the demo39s so far as non of them work the way you describe in the vid spotify now required you make a api app to get the token twilio keeps giving me errors saying my phone number is not authenticated so i havent been able to do the rest
what do we do if the access token for spotify expires chapter 2 video 2
omgosh he is an amazing presenter thanks craig
i really enjoyed the video however the trial twilio account did not work for me apparently twilio now only issues toll free numbers for trial accounts and those numbers can only be verified by business entities i reached out to support and was told the only workaround is to purchase a non toll free number
twilio exercise definitely didn39t work
is there any marketplace or place where we can go and find any api we want eg googleyoutubetwitch etcs
here is what i want to know why do i every night wake up to your videos im not subscribed im not into coding but subliminally youtube is subconsciously forcing me sense im asleep when it just decides to play this
i think you39re gonna have to update spotify part other than that amazing indeed thanks a lot
did the spotify part worked for you
monickverma2944 nope
i wish this guy didn39t sound so damn annoying
your lecture was interesting it was fun and i39m sure it was very helpful by many people39s commentsbri feel like i still didn39t grasp 100 of what you talked about the first time i may need to review it many times thanks for the useful video
you should take away the word beginners from the title
slightly funny and helpfull at the same time
i wouldn39t hire this joker
sorry this video is outdated
matheuscastelo5076 follow the tutorial and you gonna see why
i guess so could you suggest a newer one for me im struggling to understand the whole api backend stuff
know quick the spotify developers page changed and now you cannot get the token
this looks like nothing  more than twilio sponsored video
so i need a break every 15 mins i wouldn39t get anything done this way
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt651414834a
what if identified yourself as robot should you still click im not robot
don39t use spotify as a resource the console is gone now this video needs to be updated again without the use of spotify
its a little different now but you can still perform the same requests he39s demonstrating
what are api for
i fell asleep to john stewart and ended up here

mr beast  teach mode
man most of the middle of the video was about sms but in turkey i could not get a message from twilio sad but true
what the hellll
that is not working at all i cannot find the oauth in the official website of spotify which disable other operations
i love those jokes hilarious thanks craig
not a fan of this longwinded tutorial at allbrbralso injecting unfunny quothumorquot and silliness throughout the tutorial does not help your audience
great videobrbrspotify have updated their dev page and now it39s quite hard to get the oauth token it39s not as simple as in the video would be good if the notes have this in mind
i found a post from spotify community gt web api reference quotget tokenquot button where they give you a working solution
how to get it now pls help
akxshkrishnamoorthy yeah i am unable to do so too
how can i get the conversationsid
i can39t get the full request sample from the new spotify page
so good i sent myself an email link for future viewing
what are the certifications that we can obtain
this man deserves more money

nice explanation thank you sir
what are the best prerequisite videos to watch before this one  to cover the basics he mentioned toward the beginning
what does this mean quotnote if you are running powershell delete the curl alias for invokewebrequest by adding the following command to your profile cusersltusernamegtdocumentswindowspowershellmicrosoftpowershellprofileps1quot
by default windows power shell has an alias set up for curl which maps quotcurlquot to a different command you can get around this by either following the note or by explicitly typing curlexe instead of curl when running curl commands in powershell
what is that device a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt446811428a
spotify console has moved to a quotconsole likequot page at the home page this tut looks great but hard to follow in 2024
you use your computer terminal during the spotify api section curl runs on mac without any install
why is this guys so good at explaining this
quotahoy worldquot
too much noise stick to the topic and stop story telling too much time wasted
this is the most amazing video
started listening to beyonce after this course

hello  i39m craig and i39m a developer my age is 24 with a face of an old person
this educator immediately reminds me of my favourite teacher of all time i was 14 in 9th grade in new delhi and the teacher was mr atri and he taught us mathematics an absolutely brilliant man and an amazingly intriguing teacher who taught me mathematical concepts that i still remember to this day and i39m almost 35 years old now
appreciate the pokemon reference at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt14592419a mark for quotgotta collect catch them allquot
50 minutes in how do i get the authorization token to paste in curl format
did you get yeh token
i could not find it either
shifasheikh9261 no they39ve changed their website
chop a bulk of knowledge into pieces lecture then make lil bit fun respectively i can tell you make me fully focus on ur vid thank you sir a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgepgfyk2kp6mr8op1oqawaca
right now im at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt14452405a till now so much of tqlk with bad jokes as a distraction just teach what i came for man
wow it was all so clear and well explained i even laugh a lot with your jokesbrnice job craig
i was stuck at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt611214152a  i needed to uncheck quotdisable inherit valuesquot
i hate the bad jokes such a huge distraction
i didn39t know that  thing in gmail thank you will help me a lot
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt14232343a
every school needs one craig
unfortunately i was unable to do the twilio part as twilio has blocked my account right after registration they sent me an email asking to provide the reason why i39m using their service after my honest reply that i39m just learning api and a reference to this video they said they couldn39t restore my account because my quotuse case is not supported by their servicequot the video is still very useful and easy to watch thank you
you are wonderful thank you for blessing us all with your wisdom and expertise
please stop with humor

i don39t know how to code yet i am a bit lost in this video yes he dresses it up nicely  but  not sure if he is really happy in all that mess maybe he is
this dude is saul goodman
i39m so hyped and that teacher hypes me even more explations superb
oh this is exactly what i was looking for thank you so much you are a fantastic teacher
great teacher but i wish so many of the examples weren39t done with something so quotconnectedquot tons of verification required for using twilio which really slows things down twilio verification changes in november 2023 made it impossible to actually execute those examples as a hobbyiststudent if you39ve got some experience in development you can adapt these examples as needed but for novices it may be a bit more difficult to follow along than was promised
yeah i can39t use the twilio or the spotify example do you have any other sites that offer similar dev resources to test with
i am using windows 11 and i can not see any of the spotify stuff you are teaching it only work on mac os
worked up to 4ku on codewars learning to functionally program around small isolated problems and then ran into an api project and have no idea where to start forums and searches led me here it39s weird feeling like you learned something only to realize you can39t do anything useful with it hoping this video helps edit on the way
why this guy looks like mr beast father

so api  function
woke agenda in this tutorial
this is great i am struggling in the spotify part with the oauth like dennis mentioned the ui has changed in the dev section brhas anyone been successful with the oauth part i keep getting a 400 error
daverobertson8138 did you get the oauth token where did you get it from
shifasheikh9261 they require you to create an app id to get an oauth token now i recommend skipping that part of the video
definitely a tutorial to watch for learning with immersive experience
i do like the fact that freecodecamp gives us these informations for free but i just can39t stop getting annoyed by the fact that craig dennis used twillio api which is the company that he works for it39s like promoting yourself i would not care if it was a free api but it is not and it39s not worth the hassle don39t get me wrong in anyway i am grateful for this course but wish he would have used a free api which would give us a tool in our repository instead of an api we will only use for 10  15 messages give or take

this video was amazing great just great thanks fcc and craig for your dedication
hey someone please tell what are the preliminary requirements before starting to learn this i am a beginner non it  have some understanding in networking and python programming
what a messed up video
i can use kali linux apps can i programm
10mins into the course but i have to thank him for making learning so fun he39s a really good teacher
very informative thank you
for those wondering what was that on a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt6221022abrbrit39s in ruby language brchrord39y39  0x20brbr1 ord39y39  the ord method in ruby returns the ascii code of the character passed to it in this case ord39y39 returns the ascii code for the character 39y39 which is 121brbr2 0x20  this represents the hexadecimal value 20 which is equivalent to 32 in decimalbrbr3  xor operator the xor exclusive or operator performs a bitwise xor operation on the binary representations of two numbersbrbr4 ord39y39  0x20 this bitwise xor operation is performed between the ascii code of 39y39 121 in decimal and 32 the result is 89brbr5 chr89  the chr method in ruby converts an ascii code to its corresponding character in this case chr89 returns the character with the ascii code 89 which is 39y39brbrso the overall expression chrord39y39  0x20 takes the character 39y39 performs a bitwise xor with 32 resulting in the ascii code 89 and then converts that ascii code back to the character 39y39
well done for the info i like how you broke it down into pieces for better explanation
this also works with python
also the old video showed python at that part so it is not ruby
when i first started programming i really couldn39t understand xor or its purpose wish i read this back then
i can39t stop the video
i don39t want to take a single breakbrun till i understand what is api
waste of time
curl for spotify doesn39t work for me i have 39invalid access token39 error why
di developer interfaceas opposed to ui is better than api
i wish your video will also be available in multiple languages like hindi i find difficult in understanding in english
i cannot verify my number at twiio what should i do
amazing course  i39ve purchased a course from udemy that i followed during days and didn39t understand apis to be honest but this video made a lot of things very clear

where has the console gone in spotify
i am getting an unexpected token error when trying to run explorejs anyone seen this i am doing exactly what i see but in windows
why does he look like mr beast
he even talks like him
this api course is interesting and funny
i got a project to manage apis and this course helped me sooo much to better understand what am i getting myself into  thank you soooo much
great course i was trying to follow along with the spotify example and i cannot find the spotify web api console i found a post in the spotify community where someone was asking where the console was but there was no response does anyone know how to access the console if it is still available
i ran into the same issue did you figure it out
payambabakhanlou7145id skip spotify they changed the interface you also need an app id if you want to get access
unfortunately it looks like spotify have changed their web developer user interface in the uk at least and the process for getting started with using spotify39s api is very different to how it looks in this tutorial there is no longer a console that you can access from your browser you have to install multiple quotpackagesquot locally on your machinebrbrspotify have made a tutorial spread over a dizzying number of hyperlinked pages to build an app so in order to do the first tutorial for this video which requires the console i went through some of the process not knowing what i was installing or what i was doing to try and get a command line environment that accesses spotify39s api and eventually gave up it didn39t seem like that process was going to get me to a point where i could do the exercise in the video  brbrmaybe spotify view having their own tutorial as an even more accessible developer environment but it made following this video impossible for me
i also have the same problem and i39m really frustrated to be honest
samegabirilwan1987 really frustrating i finally found a course with a teacher that seems great and none of it works
9 months later beyonce has not 32m but 46m subscribersi wonder how many of those came from watching this tutorial d
this was a good course but it got tainted by some political biasesbrjust teach man br

i wish we had teachers like him in our schools and colleges that would have made us better learners

terrific teaching but i couldn39t get the image to work the text came thru with no image and i don39t think the suggested image was in the notes i couldn39t find it anyway as a result i also got a 401 when following the thunder client section
this content is so well put together  thanks
xerox parc is perhaps one the most underrated companiesorganizations in our history being one of the most innovative yet most would rather believe that apple is at frontier of pioneerism but did they invent ethernet the gui the computer mouse the desktop interface objectoriented programming language how about the laser printer all they have done is steal ip
youre superior for creating this hosting video ive experimented with hostgator and godaddy however cloudways with tst20 coupn is the best cash saver
i was summonded for jury duty on the day i was supposed to start a new gig  i had to explain what an api was to the judge  my little wheels were churning so i didn39t sound condescending but explained it enough  i came up with the rosetta stone translations that couldn39t all be stored on a phone so api calls from a little phone app would be made to a website or cloud repository
thanks for the amazing video
awesome and lively presentation
happy early birthday its oct 9th atm
who runs the terminal curlloved that joke good video thank you
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt14002320a
very clear video thanks everything39s clear
ive got your token and im about to do very evil things with it
that little beat at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt10861806a is crazy
thank you so much for this course it39s very well made useful and better than some paid courses i have seen
craig dennis is awesome
best teacher everrrr
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt33555555a did end up being so funny because i zoned out and back in and you were still talking about 39who runs the terminal39 curl beyonce link ha but i wont forget that link now either
when i copy the request sample from spotify it39s not working in cmd
spotify not providing authtoken anymore i just followed the steps
always showing no token provided or invalid access token how can i generate this this is getting annoying
did you find a solution i have the same problem maybe all next parts of this course will consist old not working stuff i dunnobrbrbtw looks like there are really few guys including us who trying to do it with course39s author that39s interesitng
den1snovikov no i didn39tbrbri didn39t continue the course as well due to frustration
thankyou so much
thanks for the good web hosting knowledge ive examined hostgator and godaddy however cloudways with tst20 coupon is the budgetfriendly selection
spotify console is no longer here so following along is really hard
i cant get an accces token to run the code in my terminal
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt26264346a just here to say that the line on beyonce taking the api dev to red lobster wasn39t lost in the crack clever wordplay
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt25784258a
who runs the terminal
you are or male or female thats it
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt575935a apis are like functions that could be called over the internet
i think the api is updated and now to get the token we must already create our app to get the token
exploring spotify api and my token is being shortened how can i fix that
my curl get request isn39t working in the terminaleverything seems to have changed since the time upload of this course the token is incomplete how can i fix that
i couldn39t get the twillio command line code to work and kept giving the error message that no credentials provided twillo must have changed regarding using a test account in command line because the support materials state that quottwilio test credentials will not work with twilio cliquot otherwise i agree that this is a good course i know things do not remain the same and get changed sometimes
did anyone have any issues trying to find console on spotify wanted to follow along but i guess spotify updated and i could not follow along
the spotify dev page has changed considerably and feel its extremely difficult to follow this class now
i don39t know why but this guy is look like old mrbeast
lmao that39s exactly what i thought
craig looks like mr beast grandpa
was the best course until you stopped talking about the course information and starting talking about people39s gender
htt pbrhtt p
spotify has changed their api docs there isn39t a console anymore
most woke teacher ever why is he apologizing after making every pun if you39re so embarrassed after making it just don39t make it ruined all the fun of those pins with his followed apology
apppostquotapiquotbrasync def postcommentbr    return jsonresponsestatuscode200 contentquotfcc you rockquot
i can39t do the spotify web api from my terminal because it hides the access token even when i hit the copy button on spotify it still doesn39t give me the complete token and then says quotinvalid access tokenquot for the error reason the interface has changed quite a bit since this video there wasn39t anywhere to create the token and it certainly doesn39t look like the one in the video so none of this works for me
hi bro i have the same problem the the user interface changed and console link not availble
you cannot  prove any api  with tty
the course is going great so far one thing though how do i get the oauth token from spotify39s api from their updated website that has been an issue
this guy has the maximum value of charisma
this guy is amazingbrbrhes hit all the right spots of a good course
consult and implement your api integration
pretty good job thanks
huge thanks to craig dennis and freecodecamp this is truely an amazing and helpful video
i just cant find the way to generate the token it seems the interface changed and well i am stuck there
great course thanks so much for referring to your first example programmer as she
my kind of teacher
if api is not invented  what would happened
best teacher i ever met
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt30705110a
boo on the inclusivity add just teach us about api39s
i love your teaching style  makes it less daunting to learn  i did get stuck on the twilio example when i ran the curl code in a hrefhttpcolabgooglecolabgooglea it returned a syntaxerror invalid decimal literal  i tried to figure it out but it was over head  i tried to find that darn decimal and could not  any direction would help please otherwise thank you for taking the time to make this for us who need it
that video is very informative helped me a lot to understand api39s
ok at this point i need to donate or something because this is such high quality educational content
this is one of the most playful and fun tutorial freecodecamp has ever added
the spotify developer console isn39t currently available from jan 2023brplease update the course
very good content by the way i found it hard to learn elsewhere the new tech since last 13 years recently i got my visa approved for canada and i m looking to move there i heard they have more requirement for this skillset in combination with mainframe could you please elaborate how mainframe use restapi as a front end i think i heard you saying api is always backend so what is my company implying by using backend data with involvement of zos connect and postman we use 3270 mainframe systems and 3270 online front end system i heard they implemented  a system fix by using cics cobol program by sending some data to cics and that data i guess was pulled by zos somehow and it was getting rendered on a website in form of something looked like someone created a restapi services using postman and this new api was accessing data from what was printed on a cics job running in queue online during the day when the developer test his changes which is sort of making sense nowcan you help me understand if i m understanding it right
dude you saying too many pointless words in between that i just cant follow the course
if anyone is losing their mind because the jq wasn39t working be sure you have it installed first
just only watched this will go back and do all the bits n bobs  great course explained stuff to me in the words that i needed  thank you

sir can i become your student
man the asynchronous js i learned a month ago finally synced in when i watched the video 6 that39s how it works awesome tutorial
30 minutes in and i39m still not sure what an api is
so essentially its code that take input from the front end and it send the data in a specific format like json to the backend the server then the server responds with with a http code and with the data that you requested i think in json and the type of api most commonly use is restapi and graphql also api are used to provide the data of your application to other application so if i want info from twitter like profile info likes posts etc then i need to get twitter api functions to request the data i wantlast thing why api are important it allows apps to use data from another app and integrate it into their own apps
thank god let you go to me

best videos
nice video
feedback please mention about windows not needing the backslashes in the terminal earlier you mention it around a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt405010730a when it would have been better to mention it before actually copying and pasting curl stuff into the terminal

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt29944954abri39m stuck at this part as spotify changed how to get access to authorization token you have to run a curl command but when i copy and paste in into my terminal changing the necessary parameters as needed client id and client secret it doesn39t work i39m on windows btw i made sure that curl is installed it isbrwhat am i doing wrongbrbredit nevermind i got it to work its a bit annoying that the text editor i39m using notepad to post the copied code into first to be able to make changes to the parameters doesn39t allow me to copy and paste the code from the text editor to the terminal i have to get rid of any newline characters if anyone more experienced then me can give me some good text editors to work  in please let me know

great course the teacher explain very good each content
thank you i am trying to catch up on technology enough to understand what is being said everything is connected to used by or based on other things codes protocols okay that list could go on but the only thing i knew about api39s was that my wordpress needed one and i have to update mine every once in a while i knew it was a type of identifier but that was all then i started hearing more talk about api39s in the talks on ai artificial intelligence
very well explained sir i have loved the examples thanks so much

turned it off at the a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt22453725a mark  absolutely ridiculous  there is no need to fuel the flames of mental disorder  there are only 2 genders  there always have been  that is just simple science and a natural law of the universe  mother nature  saying that is not uninclusive it39s literally just a fact
true but that39s his opinion we are just here to learn about api
the only mental disorder is you refusing to learn something because it hurt your feelings a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgygf1xpgummjk8gsdri2wcxa
how childish
love this course but the amount of commercials is insane
absolutely love the energy wonderful instructor thank you all so much for the free knowledge
very nice course thank you
loved loved loveddddd this thank you
3 hours of ads
api is not an acronym it39s an initialism
maybe an interesting course but spotify changed twilio tells me my german phoneverificationnumber is expired 5 sec after receiving  for me it makes no sence to continue who knows what will be after 1 or  2 hours learning not happy
for the windows user i39d suggest using gitbash instead of the command prompt that way the commands used in curl are the same just like mac and linux
i have been stuck on this part for an hour trying to get it to workbrthanks
can you be more specific about using windows at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt684015400a i39m a bit lost can retrieve the token nor the sid and i can39t move on
mando6707 are you using command prompt gitbash or another terminal
yo bro use npm init at the base of your directory to start node projectmando6707
i was stuck on this until i realized i wasn39t the only one thanks for your comment
oh i love this teaching method
came here because everything in the cloud is an api call anyway don39t mind me just making myself some notesbrbrinterfaces provide a way of usinginteracting with sthbrapi allow programsprogrammers to use stuff without knowing the implementation for common enough tasks
the teacher earns my attention from the first second this video was recommended by youtube and i am so excited i am learning python and why not to take a course on api39s by a great instructor so excited your students and your family must be proud of you i have take so many online courses i have to say you have the best way of teaching thank you
with neurolinks coming you mite get to download dancing
so is this video the course
video 3
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt12692109a
love this
what should i watch first https method video or this api one
but where is the developer console has it been renamed or what i39m stuck
hey everyone unfortunately he is right about the spotify page being different problem is they39ve removed the ability to generate authentication tokens and curl statements in the browser and while still possible it39s a much more difficult process i39d recommend just watching the spotify part and then jumping in at the twilio part
that makes sense you said it39s still possible to generate the tokens in the browser how do you do that i have been stuck on this step for over a week now thanks
rentaplace sorry i meant that it39s been removed from the browser and you have to generate your authentication token externally making the request in your languagetool of choice the nice thing is i would not linger on the spotify part the very next api he teaches twilio has it39s authentication token available in the browser and then he shows tools like postman that will show you how to go back to spotify and make that authentication token just watch and do the rest of the video and then come back and do the tougher spotify part after you will know 100 how to handle it
thanks i decided to come to the comments to see if other people had trouble with the changes to spotify
runeblade484 i39m stuck here don39t know how to generate the api token how did you get it
mrhoboninjapirate thank you for saying this i39ve been struggling here for a bit trying to get an auth token and thought it was me
need free ecommerce api with multiple categories and products
what is that
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt8251345a
i cannot find the console page in spotify developer page
this guy is amazing i am wondering how he makes study so enjoyable i want my kid has teachers like him even breaks are included wow
brought to you by twillio lol
that was a great course enjoyed it so much bri am curious if it is also possible to receive a certificate after testing our new knowledge of this course
i don39t understand a word this guy is saying
is a scam
accointing by glass mode is a seam
accointing
am subscribe
did not understand some my dig not understanding wont wont go my brain brain wont ferda it must be drunk not for this i watch it
i keep getting this message when i tried to install curl on my mac quot curl 22 the requested url returned error 404quot any help on how to proceed will be appreciated thanks
just 10 min into this video and i fell in love with his teaching wow
great tutorial i39ve had fun the whole time while learning but i39m trying to use twilio and phone number verification is not going through i am in nigeria please is there a workaround for this challenge
good teacher bad course materialbr spotify api is changing so fast that i could not find the curl requests you show on the current spotify sitebr twilio might be a cool website but no way i give my number and email to try it br you explained really good at the start but then you started talking mostly about the company you work for twilio and things that are not importantbrbrhonest review 2 of 10 and 2 is only for the sense of humor
do you suggest any other courses
this course is amazing but since it was creating spotify recently updated their entire developers section and the console is missing entirely and i can39t figure out how to get the oauth token branyone figured this out yet
i second this it seems like it no longer uses curl at all and the page is now the ugliest shade of purple although that may not be relevant
you have to create an app and then use a language like javascript to send a request for the token and then manually assemble your own curl statement unfortunately it39s complicated enough to no longer be quotbeginnerquot friendly so i39d recommend just watching that part and jump in at the twilio section or trying a different api tutorial
mrhoboninjapirate this is what i ended up doing actually
mrhoboninjapirate ah i see i wasted too much time on this
its okay
great tutorial but sadly console is gone with spotify
hey folks can i know what has been deprecated
i love this class anyone else getting a 502 error for the twilio developer documentation
i just cant understand how to use curl with windows
if gender is not a problem why did they ask
craig is a very fun and enjoyable instructor but this whole video is pretty much a ii twilio adbrbr i signed up and used it once to send sms but not likely to use it again i did watch whole video made notes
amazing way of teaching
why as a developer you cannot afford a better quality microphone
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt22383718a 1999 ganggg
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt415510915a at no point in my life has anyone ever told me that quotahoyquot was ever an unofficial way to greet on the phone
is this the best teacher i39ve ever come across bryes it definitely is i love this man made learning so funful and enjoyable you just can39t skip any part i rewind when i miss a single statement thanks a bunch for letting him teach
spotify changed its configuration completely and now i am completely lost   seems waaaayyy more complicated to get a token  i am sooo lost omg
same i cant even find the console
same i tried creating an app and using the client secret under setting gt basic information still getting a token error in command prompt
is it just me or it is impossible to go on twilio  i have been trying to create an account multiple time with different email and everytime i try to sign in the page refresh over and over again and tell e there is an error i did try to reply to trilio39s message when they sent an email about verifying my identity to protect them of fraud but they never replied back  and my account is still blocked  and when i try to create a new account it does the same thing again
i suffer the same problem remove the quot  quot behind your email in register
whps51205  i didnt put the  sign and it still didnt let me
i have no idea how to request oauth token from this new spotify ui it seems like we are required to have an app with uri provided anyone has any clue
i just typed something random in there i managed to get a client secret i39m not 100 sure if its the same thing as a token i39m guessing not because i keep getting a token error in command prompt
the guy is a truly righteous and son of god he deserves heaven
you are a brilliant and gifted educator thank you
bruhhh this guy is soo fun
i have not decided if this is a good course or not for instance i thought the speaker was saying 39restbox39 there is a 39restbox39 out there but does not do what his did i played him saying it over and over after reading the notes i learned he was saying 39restfox39 he needs to speak slower and enunciate clearly one should not have to rewind over and over again just to get a simple point
bookmark a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt473753a
i wasnt able to find this console thing on spotify at all
same it looks like there was an update on 3272023  he wasn39t kidding about spotify looking different from the beginning
this course has been an incredibly fruitful experience for me and i can confidently say that it39s one of the best things i39ve ever done in my life as someone who has been programming for almost a decade gaining a deep understanding of how apis work has taken my skills to a whole new level
br
bri39m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course and i want to express my appreciation to those who made it possible this is exactly how education should be interactive engaging and straight to the point the practical handson approach of the course has allowed me to learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively and i39m confident that the knowledge i39ve gained will prove invaluable in my future endeavors thank you again for creating such a fantastic learning experience
ha a decade i started to learn coding js and scratched some html and css since a month ago and whenever i meet a new term like i did with api i take a coursebri can not help myself to not know things while i do something and i think it will be my doom in the programming world as i got the feel it would take me forever to grasp all the concepts and terminology
yeah can you explain the upper is method or api brin this course he said that to change to upper we all need is api

hey when did mr beast started teaching
forbr5 secs l also was amazed
my jq did not work i get 39jq39 is not recognized as a in internal or external command operable program or batch file
nonbinary and quoti dont want you to feel offendedquot what a moron
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt480800a
extreme cringe
url is uniform resource locator not universal i only know that because they also got it wrong on university challenge
sorry if this has already been addressed but i am stuck at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt117157a because i am on windows and neither the linux or the windows options worked to load the environment credentials  anyone else have this problem and maybe a hint what to do  great video btw thank you
thank you so much i learned a lot about apis from this course
1  this such a great great class i39m following everything and learning gobs since i39ve been out of the programming world for 10 years
br2  small issue on setting up restfox to send the dvd picture  no matter what i did it would not send  my final troubleshooting step was to send a very small picture and that worked
bris there a size restriction causing an issue or am i using the wrong url  what is the url  it is not in the notes
br3  the notes for unit 2 video 4 are very very sparse can they be touched up
same issue here can39t seem to send an image even tried a 1kb jpeg but no joy
dannykryan to be clear i was able to send the much smaller cloud picturebri set up the entire request and sent with an unchecked the mediaurl which worked checked the mediaurl which failed then unchecked the mediaurl and  resent again which worked  this proved that the issue was the mediaurl and it alonebrthen i chose a much smaller picture that workedbri think case matters so mediaurl is not good you have to use mediaurl
spotify apis are only available for the us uk ireland new zealand and australia markets
i got completely lost at unit 2 video 4  postmanrest foxi guess i39ll give your first video tutorial i see others mentioning a try
perfect video for api thanks dennis
great course
5 minutes in and am already a fan you are a new subscriber
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt2002a steve jobs is that you
i learned about this concept in school but it was only briefly covered in a database class and i never understood the point of it until my last job they were manually configuring hundreds of appliancetype devices through their web ui39s which took hours of work one small change request was many more hours of work again i realized that these appliances had an api and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of ip39s and sent api commands to each device in the list i did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half brbras someone who is in it but is not a developer even i could see the enormous power and potential of the api it opens the door to automation which reduces human error dramatically it also speeds up onboarding i am looking forward to watching this course and learning more about api39s and their other uses
how do you know how to write scripts i39m not a developer and have no idea how to write scripts
emilghiurau you39re on youtube man watch some videos
how do you send message at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt933223532a
awsome vid i can only thank you for your effort and time by delivering this amazing tutorial
best api course ever i never saw any teachers make learning course enjoyable as much as craig dennis he even teach people to take their time to relax and think
can u deploy a production api after the course
latinbishop1722 of course not the point of video is to explain api
seriously
its terrible  too much unnecessary chat complicating matters bad descriptions that look more like built in adverts and what39s his obsession with byonce doesn39t he even know its a m an
agreed

what a great video  this couldn39t be better explained  thanks  and btw is that an 8track player on the table next to the chair  how old school cool
this tutorial does not work for windows unfortunately unless you have the patience to do a lot of stack overflow research to find some workarounds to the constant errors
do i need to install anything to use jq i am using windows 10 for enterprise
i39m on windows 11 and i just put it in cwindowssystem32  i kept one copy as quotjqwin64exequot and copied another as quotjqexequot
this is a big move of educational revolution i have started my self study programming journey from fcc from zero level and right now i am in confidence level thanks a lot the whole fcc org and god bless u all from burma
bro can you please tell me what are the other topics i learn  as programmer
hello  how39s the journey going
what actually is an api after lots of code on apis time to know what it is
how can you move the cursor to the previous line at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt403310713a struggle doing that
me too i39m literally raging on my machine about it im on a mac laptop perhaps i need a cpu with a 39proper39 mouse
it39s amazing that he keeps telling us to take a break when i tried to binge the video
a lot of paience
did you really need to include all those cringey corny jokes from the old video
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt22563736a  quotprefer not to sayquot maaaay be a valid option for you brbut bryou americans amp europeans need to understand that gender is binary because of physiology brno matter deny it or run away from it
wow this video came up at the right time thank you fcc and thank you craig for making this a fun journey you have done a really amazing job at not making this tutorial a boring one i really loved the breaks and the things you did to keep the learning interesting throughout the video i wish we had more trainers  teachers like you you rock
great stuff and well presented thank you however i39m a bit stuck on the terminalclishell thing i39m running windows 11 and there seems to be the to me good old command prompt cmd and the newer powershell in neither of these does 39say39 work nor does it tell me what shell i39m using with 39echo 039  hayelp hayelp somebody help liddle ole me
the prerequisite is that you have to purchase a mac and live in the apple39s walled garden

wow  your voice sounds like all three stooges wrapped into one with all sort of up and down range in tone  you gloss over a plethora of terms and really explain none of the actual terms and yet you think we should somehow know what you are talking about for beginners   perhaps all of your friends who commented here to boost your rating or seasoned programmers who have already a good general understanding of all this understands what you are talking about  i have watched the first 30 minutes  3 times in a row  thats an hour and a half of gibberish  and i have no idea zero idea of what you are even talking about
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt7341214a  cha cha cha
thanks fro this toturaial to api
the teacher is very energetic joyful and good at teaching attracts people39s attention without boring them i enjoyed his teaching style
thank you very much a very good job i hope to learn more about api and this is a good beginning
she might take the api down to red lobster
jq is not just working on  my windows laptop
am i misunderstanding something or you need an american phone number to be able to send to your twilio phone number in the trial and follow along with this
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt8401400a  is that a radio with a 8 track
pretty rad right you can find all sorts of stuff in the prop room
this is a great course   but the problem i face all the time is that twilio restrict me from getting a twilio number my first account suspended by them after 1 second i created it  after that i created another account with another email but they restrict me from  getting a twilio number also no replies to emailsnow i am stressed about this strugglei was not able continue this course for two days because this issue feel like to give up this tutorialis there a alternative to twilio for following this course
watch this video you will not regret it such an amazing teacher thank you for such a wonderful course
when i open the url for quotwho runs the worldquot search in the browser it just opens the beyonc page but not the song itself i noticed that when he does the first search at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt32865446a even though it brings up the wrong artist page the beyonc song is there already at the bottom of the page  i guess because thats the last song played on his spotify profile so that when he then puts in the correct url at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt33405540a it brings up beyoncs main page but the same song is still there did anyone else have this happen to them and did you manage to show the correct track that was searched for the url itself seems to only refer to the artist but not the search for the track thank you
i love it when you call me big poppa hahahahahahahahahaha
pls i need help when using the spotify api the api  testing result on the spotify for developer website   is different from  that of  my vscode terminal testing result

thanks for this  helped tonnes
love learning api from mrbeast
even the voice haha
best api course on youtube
this course was brilliantly taught
ok chatgpt explain this to me as if you were craig dennis
first off carlos you39ve got this take your time learning xyz and remember at some point everyone has to learn it too this might be a bug in the ai but you got this
best
i love this guy39s charisma
thank you for this lecture
this whole course feels a bit condescending
oh no i39m sorry it came across that way for you i actively try to avoid this i appreciate your feedback if you could let me know more about this i39d love to dig into it so i can avoid making others feel this way i apologize for making you feel this way
please make a course on laravel
super insightful course thanks craig and freecodecamp
i want craig dennis to teach me all the hard things in life explain clearly and positively tell me that it39s okay to pause give yourself time be patient  these are important steps in any new business
hi elena are you a webdeveloper
i want a oracle sql and plsq
lost patience at the cringing worship of spotify and downvoted brands are not your friends and being a good consoomer shouldn39t be mistaken for  being a good developer
getting back interesting data back from an api very clever
this was fun d
thank you for making this free i feel such great gratitude
good one
how about i have a dhis2 database and it doesn39t have an exposed api to consume the data stored in the dhis2 how then do you create an api to consume the data i was thinking this is what this tutorial will be addressing and not the conventional api tutorials
i dont know why you thought it would be advanced the  title does say apis for beginners you could also have looked at the details or the comments posting the thumbnails
are you using terminal on mac the part where you typed jq and changed colors nothing happened for me
fixed it  needed to install jq from brew
how does he look better than 3 years ago kek
three minutes into the video and i39ve learned absolutely nothing about api i doubt the next three hours will be any better time to cut my losses
thanks for taking the time to comment
i love how he teaches this guy he reminds me of jesse from breaking bad i have understood things and learned new concepts so i see the light thanks
i just want to let him know that i actually laughed at the 39who runs the terminal curl39 joke dad jokes ftw
your a hrefhttpwwwyoutubecomresultssearchquery23dadjokedadjokea feedback has been received thank you
congratulations
this is the course that actually thought me how to work with api39s
i ran the same code and it returned an external url for rihanna39s artist page no matter which way i try it it won39t return beyonce weird not sure what i did wrong or how it keeps connecting rihanna from beyonce i don39t normally listen to either so it39s certainly not some stray data throwing it off
absolutely love the tone and approach to this course and thank you for making this free
wish this was written with python
jq brdoesn39t work on my computer
what operating system
thanks for this awesome tutorial
amazing teacher
please add advance modern backend development with nodejs and mongodb redis with advanced aggregation and all useful npm packages
is replit based on api as we can see all the server code running on browser
i could use an api to abstract away the quotcutesyquot parts of this presentation which would cut it down at least 40 of the distractive nonsense based on what i39ve seen so far i also acknowledge that this could be valuable for some people  but not me
i appreciate your feedback and also appreciate you thinking about how others might need it i hope it39s not too much once you get out of conceptual town i let the code keep interest i39m still dorky unfortunately
7footmoustache thank you both for the above perspectives at times even i felt like the whole video could be condensed to 60pc of what it is now  but later i realized there are people who actually benefit from the leisurely pace of learning thank you craig for the amazing video
vernon howard quotall your costumes are put on in a moment of spiritual sleepquot
got through the whole thing but when i try to view the indexhtml the link to my picture is broken and on the other hand i really want a burrito
i found out my issue i messed up the url in my src quotquot url by putting an extra 3939 ii
you deserve a burrito
7footmoustache it39s always exciting finding the solution to the error lol brbri hope there are intermediate videos to come  thanks for everything
it kind of starts 5 minutes in
2 minutes into the course and already 39i39m lovin it39
i can39t belive i just saw this video for free you guys are incredible
great video up until the point we are messing with vs code i can not for the life of me make it work in windows i get error after error after error in the terminal powershell even after following your docs on the description for windows
thank you for the feedback joo i39ll work on a screen cast to add to the notes
i would like to thank you here from brazil
de nada
bonjour thanks for video tutorial can somebody teach young two ladies for programming android
very nicebr
fantastic tutorialbri really felt like watching the 5th season of quotthe last man on earthquotbrhe repopulated the earthbrnow teaching humanity how to use apis again
can someone pelase tell me how to get permission to get number a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxsd0zgxjrwampt377510255a
account info panel
hi it is good tutorial but what about those who use windows it have encountered so many issues just running the vscode
oh no pavel i39m sorry what problems did you run into i39ll update the notes the rest of the course shouldn39t matter as it39s browser based
7footmoustache hi for example when i wanted to create the variables for the twilio id and password i adjusted the commands for windows but it still gives me error that username is required
huge thx
apart the cringe humor he is very charismatic and fluid explaining things thanks for the video
thanks for the feedback sorry for the cringe
7footmoustache the cringe humor was my favorite part here for it a hrefuckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv11ujgksify6lzfolm6akanydqaga
i39d prefer that spotify not ask gender  why do they care about that  it39s not being inclusive  it39s intrusive marketing  don39t be naive
amazing video
quoteducation isn39t meant to be binged and because of this i39ll probably remind you quite a bit to take breaksquot  the best quote i39ve heard today
gap learning is great
so far this video was done right and anyone that watches it knows exactly what i mean
paused at 4m to get a burrito looks great so far though
i wonder if they are allowed to say quothe wrote the codequot xd
cause statistically it39s more likely to be him lmao
fabulous course thank you
the instructor looks like mrbeast39s father
this video is amazing i can listen to this guy all day thank you very much
detailed explanations great course for beginners
thank you so much for this
this is really very excited to me and the host is awesome and the interaction with people is woow
thank you so much sir your work is very impressive
may i get a suggestion on how to create an api
there are multiple ones on this channel using python django net fastapi
i was just watching the old version great to have a more detailed version
thank you so much for sharing this with us on youtube  from kyoto  brbrhis api course is hands down the most accessible and lifechanging for dummies like me
definitely not for beginners and i haven39t learned that much only a few key words like rest crud curl postman and the course has taken 3 hours of my lifebri don39t know why you39re using twilio as everything you said postman is complicated twilio is on a next level of 39complicated39brwhy not use visual studio code and start from scratch using only this editor and show us how to start and finish a working project you39re trying to teach about an api so start a project in vsc take a dad jokes api as an example and teach us how everything works the main objective to use an api is for a website to be interactive and right now i don39t even know how to implement an api on a website so i can extract a user39s custom query and show that data on a website as a resultbrbrthat39s the problem with tutorials right now they39re very long and not practical unfortunately
i feel you i39ve been self studying web dev for about 6 months needed a refresher on basic api and while this was enjoyable im not sure i learned anything and took me way longer than 3 hours who is this for
dude youre such an awesome instructor i hope to one day be like you
i just finish his old api course now there39s an updated one
i really love this man39s energy he makes learning not feel cumbersome at all
wow this is the kind of teacher that inspires me the most thank you
i haven39t made it through this yet but this is very good  great work
the best video about api
very fun and cool i will finish it by tomorrow to have a total understanding of api before using it
craig39s videos always radiate warmth
the production quality here is amazing
maybe sth about wiremock
when i say foo you say bar lmao
this educator is really engaging great job
i like the way the tutorial incorporated humor thumbs up
you just entered my exact date of birth
twinsies
coincidence
does he have youtube channel
this is awesome thank you
amazing tutorial to follow
you are so great  i was waiting for your video  thanks a lot
the jokes are really good they don39t make me laugh from stomach but an entertaining chuckle is enoughbrto keep me going
i hope to get at least one belly laugh out of you just one
the video is so well created brthe editing is extremely goodbrand the explaination is good the fact that first few episodes are just exaplaination is good really good
really excited for this one saw the first one more than 5 times and enjoyed it everytime love that it is once again being refreshed
welcome back
whats the difference between old and new one
great question sanket this one uses new rest api clients in addition to postman since postman got harder to navigate as a newcomer instead of focussing on python and javascript we leaned into javascript and simplified the app creation process as that wasn39t what folks are here to learn spotify and twilio updated a ton and folks were having a hard time navigating around also i beatbox
instead of lizzo it39s beyonc
7footmoustache thanks you are doing wonderful job love your teaching style
nice
wow what a great timing will update here once done
it39s about time
hoping this is a censored lizzo reference
i39ve been waiting for this thank you
where is the course for writing an api  it already exist on this channel
angmarliche9187 cool
thank you i was going to show the old video for my class to use apis starting this week
thank you for sharing with your class i39d love to know more about them
7footmoustache showing my grade 11s in ib higher level computer science we are getting through material quickly so i wanted to show them something really useful thank you for all your videos i originally learned about apis from the first video and made something that drafted multiple post on google classroom i39m a self taught cs teacher and i would point to your videos as an exemplar online resource
are you going through my search history
i will come back in 10 years to see if the likes to this comment is at least 10 to the likes of the video for no reason
there39s an api for that use the youtube comments api
thanks a lot
wow it39s like freecodecamp is really reading my mind was planned to learn api39s and voila look what i got today
i didn39t knew mr beast had a brother
mrbro
was waiting for an api course for a while

not watched yet but i know its fye
