"&quot;Education isn&#39;t meant to be binged and because of this, I&#39;ll probably remind you quite a bit to take breaks.&quot; ~ The best quote I&#39;ve heard today."
Best api course ever. I never saw any teachers make learning course enjoyable as much as Craig Dennis. He even teach people to take their time to relax and think.
"I learned about this concept in school but it was only briefly covered in a database class and I never understood the point of it until my last job. They were manually configuring hundreds of appliance-type devices through their web UI&#39;s which took hours of work. One small change request was many more hours of work again. I realized that these appliances had an API and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of IP&#39;s and sent API commands to each device in the list. I did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half. <br><br>As someone who is in IT but is not a developer, even I could see the enormous power and potential of the API. It opens the door to automation, which reduces human error dramatically. It also speeds up onboarding. I am looking forward to watching this course and learning more about API&#39;s and their other uses."
"Hey everyone, unfortunately he is right about the Spotify page being different. Problem is, they&#39;ve removed the ability to generate authentication tokens and curl statements in the browser and while still possible, it&#39;s a much more difficult process. I&#39;d recommend just watching the Spotify part and then jumping in at the Twilio part."
"Absolutely love the tone and approach to this course, and thank you for making this free!"
Wow this video came up at the right time.. Thank you FCC.. And thank you Craig for making this a fun journey. You have done a really amazing job at not making this tutorial a boring one. I really loved the breaks and the things you did to keep the learning interesting throughout the video. I wish we had more trainers / teachers like you! You rock!
"I want Craig Dennis to teach me all the hard things in life: explain clearly and positively, tell me that it&#39;s okay to pause, give yourself time, be patient - these are important steps in any new businessüëèüëèüëè"
This is a big move of educational revolution. I have started my self study programming journey from fcc (from zero level) and right now I am in confidence level. THANKS A LOT the whole fcc org and god bless u all. From Burma..
I really love this man&#39;s energy he makes learning not feel cumbersome at all
"For the windows user, I&#39;d suggest using gitbash instead of the command prompt. That way, the commands used in cURL are the same just like mac and linux."
"This course has been an incredibly fruitful experience for me, and I can confidently say that it&#39;s one of the best things I&#39;ve ever done in my life. As someone who has been programming for almost a decade, gaining a deep understanding of how APIs work has taken my skills to a whole new level.<br><br>I&#39;m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course, and I want to express my appreciation to those who made it possible. This is exactly how education should be: interactive, engaging, and straight to the point. The practical, hands-on approach of the course has allowed me to learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively, and I&#39;m confident that the knowledge I&#39;ve gained will prove invaluable in my future endeavors. Thank you again for creating such a fantastic learning experience."
"This educator immediately reminds me of my favourite teacher of all time. I was 14 in 9th grade in New Delhi, and the teacher was Mr Atri and he taught us Mathematics. An absolutely brilliant man, and an amazingly intriguing teacher who taught me mathematical concepts, that I still remember to this day, and I&#39;m almost 35 years old now."
Gap learning is great
I was assigned a task at my job to do some testing automation using APIs and this course was a huge help. Always try to find a real world problem or something to apply what you learn to for maximum advantage
"@Rentaplace Sorry, I meant that it&#39;s been removed from the browser and you have to generate your authentication token externally, making the request in your language/tool of choice. The nice thing is, I would not linger on the Spotify part. The very next API he teaches, Twilio, has it&#39;s authentication token available in the browser and then he shows tools like Postman that will show you how to go back to Spotify and make that authentication token. Just watch and do the rest of the video and then come back and do the tougher Spotify part after, you will know 100% how to handle it."
Really excited for this one. Saw the first one more than 5 times and enjoyed it everytime. Love that it is once again being refreshed.
Is this the best teacher I&#39;ve ever come across? ü§î<br>Yes it definitely is! I love this man. Made learning so funful and enjoyable. You just can&#39;t skip any part. I rewind when I miss a single statement. Thanks a bunch for letting him teach. ‚ù§
"for those wondering what was that on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=622"">10:22</a>:<br><br>it&#39;s in ruby language, <br>chr(ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20):<br><br>1. ord(&#39;y&#39;) : The `ord` method in Ruby returns the ASCII code of the character passed to it. In this case, `ord(&#39;y&#39;)` returns the ASCII code for the character &#39;y&#39;, which is 121.<br><br>2. 0x20 : This represents the hexadecimal value 20, which is equivalent to 32 in decimal.<br><br>3. `^` (XOR operator): The XOR (exclusive OR) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of two numbers.<br><br>4. ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20 This bitwise XOR operation is performed between the ASCII code of &#39;y&#39; (121 in decimal) and 32. The result is 89.<br><br>5. chr(89):  The `chr` method in Ruby converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character. In this case, `chr(89)` returns the character with the ASCII code 89, which is &#39;Y&#39;.<br><br>So, the overall expression `chr(ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20)` takes the character &#39;y&#39;, performs a bitwise XOR with 32, resulting in the ASCII code 89, and then converts that ASCII code back to the character &#39;Y&#39;."
Paused at 4m to get a burrito. Looks great so far though!
Thank you so much for sharing this with us on YouTube ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• from Kyoto üáØüáµ <br><br>His API course is hands down the most accessible and life-changing for dummies like me
Was waiting for an API course for a while!!! üéâ
Don&#39;t use Spotify as a resource. The console is gone now. This video needs to be updated again without the use of Spotify.

I am learning python, and why not to take a course on api&#39;s by a great instructor? so excited! Your students and your family must be proud of you. I have take so many online courses, i have to say you have the best way of teaching. Thank you"
the video is so well created <br>the editing is extremely good<br>and the explaination is good the fact that first few episodes are just exaplaination is good really good
"Thanks, I decided to come to the comments to see if other people had trouble with the changes to spotify."
"@latinbishop1722 of course not, the point of video is to explain api"
"Sorry, this video is outdated."
"10mins into the course but I have to thank him for making learning so fun, he&#39;s a really good teacher!"
"Personally after completing the whole course, i won&#39;t suggest this course to anyone who wants to learn about APIs seriously. It felt more like explanation of various API tools from the second chapter rather than actual API related knowledge.<br><br>It is still a good course with a practical approach in explanation and can be taken if a fun way of learning things is your style but not for when you need immediate information or binge learning."
I was always running away from APIs but looking at this video and how easy you have made this for everyone is outstansding.  Thank you üôÇ
üòÇ I have been stuck on this part for an hour trying to get it to work.<br>Thanks!
I&#39;d prefer that Spotify not ask gender.  Why do they care about that?  It&#39;s not being inclusive.  It&#39;s intrusive marketing.  Don&#39;t be naive.
"Love the content, but dude is a beyonce stan fr üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
Great video.<br><br>Spotify have updated their dev page and now it&#39;s quite hard to get the OAuth token (it&#39;s not as simple as in the video) Would be good if the notes have this in mind
"Unfortunately it looks like Spotify have changed their web developer user interface (in the UK at least) and the process for getting started with using Spotify&#39;s API is very different to how it looks in this tutorial. There is no longer a console that you can access from your browser, you have to install multiple &quot;packages&quot; locally on your machine.<br><br>Spotify have made a tutorial (spread over a dizzying number of hyperlinked pages) to build an app. So in order to do the first tutorial for this video which requires the console, I went through some of the process (not knowing what I was installing or what I was doing) to try and get a command line environment that accesses Spotify&#39;s API, and eventually gave up. It didn&#39;t seem like that process was going to get me to a point where I could do the exercise in the video! :( <br><br>Maybe Spotify view having their own tutorial as an even more accessible developer environment, but it made following this video impossible for me."
"Definitely not for beginners and I haven&#39;t learned that much, only a few key words like REST, CRUD, CURL, POSTMAN and the course has taken 3 hours of my life...<br>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re using Twilio as everything... you said Postman is complicated, Twilio is on a next level of &#39;complicated&#39;...<br>Why not use Visual Studio Code and start from scratch using only this editor and show us how to start and finish A WORKING PROJECT. You&#39;re trying to teach about an API. So start a project in VSC, take a dad jokes API as an example and teach us how everything works. The main objective to use an API is for a website to be interactive and right now I don&#39;t even know how to implement an API on a website so I can extract a user&#39;s custom query and show that data on a website as a result...<br><br>That&#39;s the problem with tutorials right now, they&#39;re very long and not practical unfortunately."
"That makes sense! You said it&#39;s still possible to generate the tokens in the browser, how do you do that? I have been stuck on this step for over a week now. Thanks."
"I haven&#39;t made it through this yet, but this is very good.  Great work"
This educator is really engaging. Great job.
"Hello, I&#39;m on the Spotify website and it&#39;s difficult to follow along because the UI change is much less visual and literally things are not at the same places. I can adapt. I just wanted to voice the difficulty as I might not be alone. I know it&#39;s frustrating to have a video you post hit so differently already the next year!"
You should take away the word beginners from the title!
I can&#39;t get the full REQUEST SAMPLE from the new spotify page
"Thanks for the good web hosting knowledge! Ive examined HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupon is the budget-friendly selection."
"Spotify Web API Reference is changed and now that whole part of the course isn&#39;t so easy to follow --- cant get curl to work right with the samples they give, nor do I think spotify so freely gives out the key code in terms of ease of access"
I don&#39;t understand a word this guy is saying
Welcome back!
naaah...dis Mr beast older brother...Mr Beastier
"30 minutes in, and I&#39;m still not sure what an API is."
"This course is amazing, but since it was creating Spotify recently updated their entire Developers section and the console is missing entirely and I can&#39;t figure out how to get the oauth token. <br>Anyone figured this out yet?"
"If Anybody watching  in Feb 2025 <br>and Stuck on  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2346"">39:06</a> on Spotify Dev Mode  OAuth (Missing) <br><br>1) You don&#39;t need to Generate O Auth , The API create Auth Token itself . <br>You need to input only  q and type üëç<br><br>2)  If any body stuck 401 Error (49 :07)<br>- First Create Mobile App from Spotify Developer Dashboard <br>- Second You Can use Postman to get bearer token <br><br> (It helps Me in First two Step )<br>(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N34BM2CU_3g"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N34BM2CU_3g&amp;t=996s)</a><br><br>- Now you can copy Token Bearer paste in curl <br>- I am using window power shell for command <br><br>(But the output format is really bad format ) you can try another sources except command (worst for muti-line )"
"So essentially it‚Äôs code that take input from the front end and it send the data in a specific format like json to the backend( the server). Then the server responds with with a http code and with the data that you requested I think in json. And the type of api most commonly use is RestApi and Graphql. Also api are used to provide the data of your application to other application. So if I want info from twitter like profile info, likes, posts etc then I need to get twitter api functions to request the data I want.last thing: why api are important? It allows apps to use data from another app and integrate it into their own apps! üòÆ"
Your style of delivering the material is absolutely fantastic. Thank you for your hard work!
@MrHoboninjapirate Thank you for saying this! I&#39;ve been struggling here for a bit trying to get an auth token and thought it was me.
Can u deploy a production api after the course
This is the course that actually thought me how to work with API&#39;s
Craig&#39;s videos always radiate warmth
"Thank you, I was going to show the old video for my class to use APIs starting this week"
"Spotify docs changes, Twilio Docs changed, Thunder Client is now behind a paywall... But it&#39;s still good to learn the theory of API REST, and the pace of the course with pauses is great. Just sit back and watch"

"I was pretty much keeping up, then we got to Twilio.  I created an account, created a phone number.  Then I tried to verify the number.  I kept getting a pop-up asking for a business name and URL.  I never got pass that"
@skyd3vs thats what i got really frustrated after trying to find it until i saw your comment thanks
"also in the course of learning, it&#39;s a good idea to watch the video multiple times. i&#39;ll usually start each learning session with rewatching what i&#39;ve learned the day before. not only does it help for the knowledge to sink in but you pick up the bits you didn&#39;t pick up the first time. and sometimes a single word or sentence repeated is enough to commit something to memory for life. I&#39;m 54 years old, and have been a systems engineer my whole life, and have interacted with many API&#39;s, including the Twitter API, the Wordpress API, various gaming API&#39;s. I watch this sort of thing fairly regularly as computing is a fast moving field with many concepts learned either fading out with time, or replaced by newer technology. This is super important if you are currently working to keep abreast of emerging technologies you may need for upcoming projects or jobs."
"Maybe Spotify has changed since  this was  filmed, but  I cannot replicate what you are showing. I can&#39;t get the &quot;Console&quot; page; if I type in that same URL, I&#39;m redirected to  Documentation. Anyone else getting this?  Thanks."

I cannot find the console tab on Spotify for developers....what may I be doing wrong?
You should really change the title of this video and add &quot;for MAC OS&quot; because it&#39;s not really for beginners if you&#39;re using windows. I managed to get most of the thing you did to work but it did take quite a bit of googling and doing extra thing that are not mentioned in the notes. Many people would just give up and watch something else as it does take time to make this work on windows and it take away from the learning flow.
"This is my first foray into API programming. The expected changes to Spotify mentioned early in the video are quite apparent, as are considerable changes in Twilio, making the training difficult to follow. I&#39;m constantly having to pause the training to dig through the website to locate the relevant pages in order to follow the training path. The information contained is very thorough and appreciated but, it definitely needs a complete update."
Excellent introduction to APIs! üòÆ
"Spotify Does;nt have the Console in this verson!! &quot;At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2333"">38:53</a> How do I use the commands?&quot;"
"it doesnt have console but you can get the same functionality in search but still , spotify isnt giving authorization bearer token . so got stuck at that point"
"Why not take a cat nap? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=825"">13:45</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2097"">34:57</a> should we thank her first?"
"This course is quite good, however it woul&#39;ve been better if it was focused for people who already know how to code because who the hell would try to learn APIs without coding knowledge"
I&#39;m just starting with backend developing and this helped me a lot. Thank you!
"Great vid, love it. I am having difficulty with all the demo&#39;s so far as non of them work the way you describe in the vid. Spotify now required you make a API APP to get the token, Twilio keeps giving me errors saying my phone number is not authenticated, so i havent been able to do the rest."
"I think you&#39;re gonna have to update Spotify part... Other than that, amazing indeed! Thanks a lot."
"That is not working at all, I cannot find the OAuth in the official website of Spotify, which disable other operations"
this is the most amazing video
"50 minutes in, how do I get the Authorization token to paste in curl format?"
Well done for the info. I like how you broke it down into pieces for better explanation.
Curl for Spotify doesn&#39;t work for me. I have &#39;invalid access token&#39; error. Why?
Amazing course ! I&#39;ve purchased a course from Udemy that I followed during days and didn&#39;t understand APIs to be honest. But this video made a lot of things very clear
"Great Course! I was trying to follow along with the Spotify example, and I cannot find the Spotify Web API console. I found a post in the Spotify community where someone was asking where the console was, but there was no response. Does anyone know how to access the console if it is still available?"
This was a good course but it got tainted by some political biases!<br>Just teach man! <br>üòÇüò¢üôÑü§†
I wish we had teachers like him in our schools and colleges that would have made us better learners!
He reminds me of Mr.beast
"Youre superior for creating this hosting video! Ive experimented with HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupn is the best cash saver."
I was summonded for jury duty on the day I was supposed to start a new gig.  I had to explain what an API was to the judge.  My little wheels were churning so I didn&#39;t sound condescending but explained it enough.  I came up with the Rosetta Stone translations that couldn&#39;t all be stored on a phone so API calls from a little phone app would be made to a website or cloud repository.
spotify console is no longer here so following along is really hard
Did anyone have any issues trying to find Console on Spotify. Wanted to follow along but I guess Spotify updated and I could not follow along
"Most WOKE teacher ever. Why is he apologizing after making EVERY pun. If you&#39;re so embarrassed after making it, just don&#39;t make it. Ruined all the fun of those pins with his followed apology."
Great course. Thanks so much for referring to your first example programmer as ‚Äúshe‚Äù. ‚ù§
"Feedback: Please mention about windows not needing the backslashes in the terminal earlier. You mention it around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4050"">1:07:30</a> when it would have been better to mention it before actually copying and pasting cURL stuff into the terminal"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2994"">49:54</a><br>I&#39;m stuck at this part as Spotify changed how to get access to authorization token. You have to run a curl command but when I copy and paste in into my terminal, changing the necessary parameters as needed (Client ID and Client Secret) it doesn&#39;t work (I&#39;m on Windows btw. I made sure that curl is installed. It is)<br>What am I doing wrong?<br><br>Edit: Nevermind I got it to work. Its a bit annoying that the text editor I&#39;m using (Notepad++) to post the copied code into first to be able to make changes to the parameters, doesn&#39;t allow me to copy and paste the code from the text editor to the terminal. I have to get rid of any newline characters. If anyone more experienced then me can give me some good text editors to work  in, please let me know :)"
"now spotify has changed it&#39;s developer options , i can&#39;t get it&#39;s Oauth token"
same here idk how to get a token. Have you done any solution?
I couldn‚Äôt get my token form spotify ‚Ä¶.
"Awesome course only issue was that I was not able to complete the send text  request since the twilio api links to members of the US only and I cannot be able to send messages.<br>Thank you for the course, really helpful for starters."
"the only mental disorder is you refusing to learn something because it hurt your feelings <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx""></a>"
"maybe an interesting course, but spotify changed, twilio tells me, my (german) phone-verification-number is expired (5 sec after receiving ), for me it makes no sence to continue. Who knows what will be after 1 or  2 hours learning. Not happy :("
"With Neurolinks coming, you mite get to download dancing."
@Runeblade484 I&#39;m stuck here don&#39;t know how to generate the API token. How did you get it?
just 10 min into this video and I fell in love with his teaching. WOW
"Great tutorial, but sadly Console is gone with Spotify. :("
I wasnt able to find this console thing on Spotify at all
"1 - This such a great great class, I&#39;m following everything and learning gobs since I&#39;ve been out of the programming world for 10 years.<br>2 - Small issue on setting up RestFox to send the DVD picture.  No matter what I did it would not send.  My final troubleshooting step was to send a very small picture, and that worked.<br>Is there a size restriction causing an issue or am I using the wrong URL?  What is the URL?  It is not in the notes...<br>3 - The notes for Unit 2 Video 4 are very very sparse, can they be touched up?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2"">0:02</a> Steve Jobs is that you? üòÖ"
How do you know how to write scripts? I&#39;m not a developer and have no idea how to write scripts.
bro can you please tell me what are the other topics i learn  as programmer.....?????
"How can you move the cursor to the previous line at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4033"">1:07:13</a>? Struggle doing that"
"Great stuff and well presented, thank you! However, I&#39;m a bit stuck on the terminal/cli/shell thing. I&#39;m running windows 11 and there seems to be the (to me good old) command prompt cmd and the newer powershell. In neither of these does &#39;say&#39; work nor does it tell me what shell I&#39;m using with &#39;echo $0&#39; ü§î Hayelp! Hayelp! Somebody help liddle ole me! üòü"
"Ok ChatGPT, explain this to me as if you were Craig Dennis ü•∞"
this whole course feels a bit condescending
Three minutes into the video and I&#39;ve learned absolutely nothing about api. I doubt the next three hours will be any better. Time to cut my losses...
Thanks for taking the time to comment!
"Please add advance modern backend development with Nodejs and Mongodb, redis with advanced aggregation and all useful npm packages"
"I could use an API to abstract away the &quot;cutesy&quot; parts of this presentation which would cut it down at least 40% of the distractive nonsense based on what I&#39;ve seen so far. I also acknowledge that this could be valuable for some people,  but not me."
"Great video up until the point we are messing with VS Code. I can not, for the life of me, make it work in Windows. I get error after error after error in the terminal (PowerShell) even after following your docs on the description for Windows."
Thank you for the feedback Jo√£o I&#39;ll work on a screen cast to add to the notes
Fabulous course! Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
"I feel you. I&#39;ve been self studying Web dev for about 6 months. Needed a refresher on basic API and while this was enjoyable, im not sure I learned anything and took me way longer than 3 hours! Who is this for?"
"Very fun and cool, I will finish it by tomorrow to have a total understanding of API before using it"
when I say foo! you say bar! lmao
"Wow, what a great timing!! Will update here once done.."
It&#39;s about time
I will come back in 10 years to see if the likes to this comment is at least 10% to the likes of the video. FOR NO REASON.
There&#39;s an API for that! Use the YouTube comments API!
"Wow! It&#39;s like FreecodeCamp is really reading my mind. Was planned to learn API&#39;s and Voila, Look what I got today!!!"
I am not able to find Spotify --&gt; Console does it still exist
"Jus started learning about API&#39;s ..i can&#39;t spot the curl request on my spotify console..urs seemed to be at the top..but mine isn&#39;t.. although,i am using my android device for this so I&#39;m guessing the layout must be different..any advice?"
That was a rollercoaster of a review üòÖ
bro this is a huge help . i am watching this to learn about APIs as a beginner developer
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=940"">15:40</a> ada indonesia bjir"
"I thumbed through the project in the last hour of this video.  I noticed it involved Twilio.  I&#39;m at my wits end with Twilio.  I can&#39;t get the phone number verified.  I signed up 20 days ago and I have tried 3 times to verify that number.  In the second time, over two weeks went by before they rejected my verification.  There is no help and there is no way to contact Twilio."
Please i need help with the teachers note. The link isn&#39;t working
"I kind of focused in on the spotify APIs.  I have spent some time with them.  I was having some trouble with CURL.  After long discussions with ChatGPT, I decided to use request in Python on my Jupyter Notebook.  Is this the same as using CURL?  In any case, I haven&#39;t even looked at Postman yet."
All agree with some of these comments.  We are not getting enough information.  I&#39;ve just spent over an hour trying to figure out how request a token on Spotify.  At least on my Spotify there is no &quot;request token&quot; button.  I finally got a token but I had to go through ChatGPT and write a Python code just to get one.
"@hoopernamedbran3875 Laughing......Have you tried to go to the Twilio account yet?  At least with Spotify there was a work around.  At least for me, Twilio was a lot worse.  But the big problem here, this is suppose to be a video to learn about APIs.  I&#39;ve spent way more time jumping through the various hoops with Spotify and Twilio just to get the tools that this guy requires."
"I have to go back through Unit 1 a few times, take naps, and then come back again. I understand it overall, but don&#39;t know how it works."
"One of the best videos on API, and explaination.<br><br>The teacher is an absolute master of the craft.<br>What all videos/topics has he taught here or anywhere else?<br>I would love to understand topics from him."
I can&#39;t find the Spotify Console anywhere. Their website looks to havebeen completely revamped. Is there a help page for that?
The console is at the bottom of the page
Hah Mr.beast ?what are you doing here
i like his shirt
&quot;intRESTing data&quot;? I see what you did there
@KennethPhotography is it working for you now?
This is one of the BEST educators on the web.  He doesn‚Äôt put me to sleep and actually makes sense.
"Hy folks it&#39;s true, he is Veritasium&#39;s elder brother."
"Unfortunately Twilio has massively downgraded their documentation :( It looks so nice and easy to use on the video, but now it is not user friendly, especally for beginners who would be the first ones to use it. A real shame ..."
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4620"">1:17:00</a> <br>as someone Named Roxanne, I can safely speak for other Roxannes when I say we are super tired of people singing that song to us."
"&quot;Thank you Spotify for beeing so inclusive.....&quot; blah, blah, blah. I feel sick hearing that crap."
"i am exploring back end and i have used the API many times but still couldnt get the accurate grasp of it which overwhelms me, and i just have started this video and the amount of work that has been done in this video is outstanding,its friendly interactive and he explains in grass root which is my preferences to learn evrerthing, thanks to this channel and instructor."
"The best way to understand the APIs is to talk about the Windows APIs.<br>If I make a desktop Application in which the user will open files, save or save as...and print or share...<br>It will be insane to write into my application all the code needed to make new application &quot;Common User Dialogue interfaces&quot; that opens or saves as; or prints..Or shares......<br>why should I do that while Windows provides small programs and routines and common dialogue Boxes that can do all that?<br>And all I have to do is to summon them from windows system. <br>One to open Any file...An other to save as and choose the output extension...An other to open the Print page or share or copy paste...<br>It wood be insane to rewrite similar &quot;tools&quot; or &quot;routines&quot; or name&#39;em what ever you want... They&#39;re just simple &quot;APIs.&quot;<br>They are programs that Windows provides for himself first, And for all any other tiers or user&#39;s programmed apps; To make life more easy for All.<br>And those are just a few samples from a Long list of APIs that Windows and tiers offer, Like a drop of water from a big ocean."
you only needed to know how to set up your terminal. if you aren&#39;t willing to research that on your on then being a developer is not for you
Why does this dude looks like me. Beast!?
Today&#39;s lesson brought to you by Spotify!
I&#39;m sorry Craig but this needs a 2024 version from the For Developers page update
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=201"">3:21</a>  (Paraphrasing) you say that you will avoid the curse of knowledge. Few are wise enough to know this. I am impressed, and will continue."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2090"">34:50</a> &quot;I would probably search for BEYONCE. I mean, right, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>Damn. He knew."
Video 2 - Using an API from the command line is sooooooo frustrating to learn in Windows command prompt -_-
not for beginners
Thanks alot
