Ngl this was just a giant Twilio advertisement.
Are you Mr Beasts&#39; father? lol. Why do you look like you could be his father; you even sound like him at times.
I would like to reach out to you. I have been brainstorming about white labeling a already developed app and not quite sure how to do this? Can we have a conversation? Look me up on Google. Flex Transportation Services LLC out of Waukesha, WI Thank you
Bro, looks like old version of Jimmy
bruh!! for real
Great, but the dad jokes and faff is really annoying. Learning is not about unnecessary distractions.
Good tut but it is very hard to follow, the spotify developer is totally different right now(9.2025) that is presented, and even for twilio you need to provide your phone number and whole bunch of personal data. It took Instructor to setup twilio on this video almost 10 minutes.

Definitely Craig is the best, I just had the opportunity to see this videoüëç and I am totally engaging in APIs üôå
i understand theory part but I don&#39;t understand what are you Doing üò≠üò≠üò≠
dont worry. if you are a beginner it is expected that you wont understand the coding part.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=137">2:17</a> &quot;so now I have copy-pasta...&quot;
Those who have stuck with thunderclient can use EchoAPI
Collections are not available on the free version of Thunder Client
I am not getting any of it. Is it a normal syndrome üò¢
api is not a beginner level topic, you have to have a lot of background knowledge. its ok.
‚Äã@avichiii‚ù§
I am not able to find Spotify --&gt; Console does it still exist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=530">8:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=807">13:27</a>
Is there any prerequisite required for learning this course? @the educator
ohh yes. a lot. he will say you dont need any prior knowledge but you do.
Jus started learning about API&#39;s ..i can&#39;t spot the curl request on my spotify console..urs seemed to be at the top..but mine isn&#39;t.. although,i am using my android device for this so I&#39;m guessing the layout must be different..any advice?
Found itüëçüèæ
But after i copy the curl thing and paste it in the terminal..it returns status=401 message= invalid access token...  what can i do
i tried the getrequest on my terminal they all came back as status=failed..what do i do?
do i need the &#39;messanger_service_sid=token&#39; for this?
Are you using cmd by any chance?
Best lecture but too many ads.
Unecessarily long video
I don&#39;t know anything about API. Does this course cover everything about REST APIs?
no. you need to refer other resources.
I can&#39;t get access it&#39; say 401 and invalid token feel stuck if anyone wants to help
I had the same problem, turns out you can&#39;t simply click the &quot;Get Token&quot; button and select your scopes anymore. For example, at the minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2126">35:26</a>, you can see something like &quot;user-read-playback-state&quot; in the checkbox options, which you would need to select if you wanted to play a song for example. You need to do this the manual way.<br><br>IMPORTANT ADVICE: Copy paste this into chatgpt or claude, and they will guide you<br>in more detail if you need to. Also, these commands work in Windows but if you&#39;re using Mac or Linux<br>you need to ask an AI to re-write the curl command so that they work on your current OS.<br><br>Here&#39;s how to actually get a user access token with scopes:<br>You&#39;ll need to do the Authorization Code Flow manually. Here&#39;s the step-by-step:<br><br>Create the authorization URL (replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID):<br><br><a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&amp;scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-modify-playback-state&amp;redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&amp;show_dialog=true">https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&amp;scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-modify-playback-state&amp;redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&amp;show_dialog=true</a><br><br>Visit that URL in your browser - you&#39;ll be asked to log in and authorize your app<br>You&#39;ll be redirected to something like:<br><br>http://localhost:3000/callback?code=AQC4O2vudeoMDoPDubh...<br><br>Copy the code parameter from that URL<br>Exchange it for an access token:<br><br>bashcurl -X POST &quot;<a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token">https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token</a>&quot; \<br>-H &quot;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; \<br>-d &quot;grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=YOUR_CODE&amp;redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&quot; \<br>-u &quot;YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&quot;<br><br>The response will include your access_token with the proper scopes.<br>If you get the &quot;Invalid redirect URI&quot; error means the redirect URI you&#39;re using in the authorization URL doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s configured in your Spotify app settings.
Thank you for empathizing with your learners. It feels like I&#39;m listening to my best friend talk.
Honored to be your API BFF!
i hate i hate i absolutely hate watching long boring educational videos but you&#39;re such a fun educator it didn&#39;t even felt like a lecture i&#39;m so into watching the entire course ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
That was a rollercoaster of a review üòÖ
‚Äã@craigsdennishahaüòÇ
awesome
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=5752">1:35:52</a> I&#39;m a bit confused what does the query do? and what needs to go in the body?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=69">1:09</a> why do you have TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN to be Spotify API token? Aren&#39;t those two unrelated APIs?
This course will help me for QA role ü§î ?
thank you stranger for making this helpful video! I appreciate it!
Thank you stranger for the comment
Buddy made a PP joke in the middle of this session
Agreed...He is one of the best educators on the web.
Thank you!
except for the great content, I really do appreciate your sense of humor
mr beast from coding background
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=792">13:12</a> by this time i was already overloaded with info and listening at 0.75 speed<br>I really love his style of teaching. its so fun and absorbable into my dense brain ‚ù§
Guys are you facing the same problem on Twilio I couldn&#39;t find the message resource
naaah...dis Mr beast older brother...Mr Beastier
I was in a coffee shop while saying &quot;P&quot; üòÇ
He looks like MrBeast if you notice carefully.
Hi, I want to learn about APIs, but I want to know a learning path. Before I start the video, which path should I take?
‚ÄúLook at me, I‚Äôm relatable!‚Äù Please‚Ä¶I just want to learn about APIs.
great stuff ,but the problem is i understand ,but when i see and code its fine ,otherwise blank,any suggestions
bro this is a huge help . i am watching this to learn about APIs as a beginner developer
Hi Craig<br>how did you send a message that you are referring at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=9323">2:35:23</a><br>please assist, thank you
Also lesson has an impressive API to interact with studentsüòÅ. Thanks guys, it best of all I have ever learn.üëèüëèüëè
He&#39;s fairly annoying.
Thank you
Spotify docs changes, Twilio Docs changed, Thunder Client is now behind a paywall... But it&#39;s still good to learn the theory of API REST, and the pace of the course with pauses is great. Just sit back and watch
Yeah couldn&#39;t complete any of the demos more or less. But it&#39;s still a good vid.
such a lovely teacher &lt;3
Peace, Thank You

Thanks very much for the videos, really insightful. <br>But from security perspective i will just say when your editing the video you can just blur any sensitive information.
Thank you, Mr. Beast of Development.
I thumbed through the project in the last hour of this video.  I noticed it involved Twilio.  I&#39;m at my wits end with Twilio.  I can&#39;t get the phone number verified.  I signed up 20 days ago and I have tried 3 times to verify that number.  In the second time, over two weeks went by before they rejected my verification.  There is no help and there is no way to contact Twilio.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=840">14:00</a>
Im sorry i didnt understand how to use an api other than twilio..something in general
This explanation is pretty good.
Please i need help with the teachers note. The link isn&#39;t working
I kind of focused in on the spotify APIs.  I have spent some time with them.  I was having some trouble with CURL.  After long discussions with ChatGPT, I decided to use request in Python on my Jupyter Notebook.  Is this the same as using CURL?  In any case, I haven&#39;t even looked at Postman yet.
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=621">10:21</a>, why is the upper() function in python used for making all characters in a string uppercase called the API?
All agree with some of these comments.  We are not getting enough information.  I&#39;ve just spent over an hour trying to figure out how request a token on Spotify.  At least on my Spotify there is no &quot;request token&quot; button.  I finally got a token but I had to go through ChatGPT and write a Python code just to get one.
you could have gotten the token directly from your terminal tho
man you have no idea how right you were, at least i kinda got practice while trying to figure it out, took like a hr
@hoopernamedbran3875 Laughing......Have you tried to go to the Twilio account yet?  At least with Spotify there was a work around.  At least for me, Twilio was a lot worse.  But the big problem here, this is suppose to be a video to learn about APIs.  I&#39;ve spent way more time jumping through the various hoops with Spotify and Twilio just to get the tools that this guy requires.
@larryhatcher8927 yeah i couldn&#39;t figure out how to refresh my token for spotify, i&#39;m gonna just watch it through at this point and then hop on to another tutorial
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4563">1:16:03</a>, at &quot;here&quot; what and where is he using, opening?
to many information, make it simplier dude..sorry but dislike :(
i woke up to this... wow
I was pretty much keeping up, then we got to Twilio.  I created an account, created a phone number.  Then I tried to verify the number.  I kept getting a pop-up asking for a business name and URL.  I never got pass that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=46">0:46</a>
He will tell you what needs to be done but will never tell you how to do it. Buddy what was the purpose of this video.

to be honest started off well but how the extension and the app works is poorly explained
idk if its just me but why he look like mr beast
great content....... also you have quite a good resembelence with rick of pawn stars
Best chanel everüéâ
I was always running away from APIs but looking at this video and how easy you have made this for everyone is outstansding.  Thank you üôÇ
me too same thought
I can&#39;t find the Spotify Console anywhere. Their website looks to havebeen completely revamped. Is there a help page for that?
The console is at the bottom of the page
didnt find it either....
Hah Mr.beast ?what are you doing here
I can&#39;t unsee it now
i like his shirt
so interesting personality wao really was so confused about api but Mr api is next level
&quot;intRESTing data&quot;? I see what you did there
Hello guys was anyone able to access the Teachers note...The link is not working here
The link still works for me, but now it says, &quot;This repository was archived by the owner on May 13, 2025. It is now read-only.&quot;
@KennethPhotography is it working for you now?
@emmanuelgrant312 Yes, still loads for me, with the message about it being archived and read-only.
really nice.. thanks for sharing this course! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/rocket-red-countdown-liftoff"></a>
we should use the &#39;faux API&#39; platform to create free unlimited storage and APIs

Thanks a lot!<br><br>Sth I want to add to this:<br>We can use Git Bash too..
The course is good BUT you should go straight on points...TOO MUCH USELESS BLA BLA BLAüò¢
I have a better name for it.  I call it bullshit.  Also  both Spotify and Twilio gave me a ton of problems.  This course is outdated and strays off course on almost every point
Where do U find the notes of this video that is discussed in the first few minutes of this video?
Love this tutorial but I can access the notes
I cannot find the console tab on Spotify for developers....what may I be doing wrong?
same here if you found so please put it down here it will be helpful
@mohamedshakeel146 they combined console with the documentation
Waste of my time. At 44 min he says hes using MAC! And he does no know Windows! Wow
This is one of the BEST educators on the web.  He doesn‚Äôt put me to sleep and actually makes sense.
Thank you so muchü•∞
Hy folks it&#39;s true, he is Veritasium&#39;s elder brother.
Unfortunately Twilio has massively downgraded their documentation :( It looks so nice and easy to use on the video, but now it is not user friendly, especally for beginners who would be the first ones to use it. A real shame ...
Yeah, it seems like most of the stuff that he talks about Twilio API collections at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=6263">1:44:23</a> is now gone, or at least set to Private...
I got an error message code:21608 even though my number is verified. Is it possible its cos its a nigerian number? I rechecked and its verified on twilio
This is really the best video to watch to understand API&#39;s properly, so well done and easy to follow

i am exploring back end and i have used the API many times but still couldnt get the accurate grasp of it which overwhelms me, and i just have started this video and the amount of work that has been done in this video is outstanding,its friendly interactive and he explains in grass root which is my preferences to learn evrerthing, thanks to this channel and instructor.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=830">13:50</a>
More than an API course, this course feels like a deep dive into the Twilio website.
Great
i am not able to send messages  to my twilio phone number using my indian contact no ? has anybody faced the same issue if yes how did u resolve it ?

This is the best Api course which I have found in this globe ‚ù§‚ù§üòä My only request will be have a much more interactive thumbnail!!! I had this video in my feed for around a year or two but for some reason I<br> didn&#39;t click on it to watch it, oh wait I<br> know the reason! It is simply because I didn&#39;t find the thumbnail<br> appealing!! I&#39;m just Giving my<br> opinion here! And the best thing which I<br> learnt Apart from api is don&#39;t judge<br> a book by it&#39;s cover or nevertheless<br> a video by it&#39;s thumbnail üòÇüòÇ by<br> the way a heartfelt shoutout to the<br> instructor who made this course in so<br> much interactive and fun manner üòäüòä‚ù§
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=9355">2:35:55</a> how did he sent the message ? Through the sms or what?
same i also want to know that, i am not able to send message as  these are us based nos and my verified no is +91 (INDIA) .
Bro, I am also stuck in that. If anyone knows the answer please let me know
Where‚Äòs the link to the tutorial explaining how to make my own api?
Truly amazing, It was truly amazing. Take a break and enjoy rest.
Thank you for the tutorial, but the teaching notes are not accessible. the links are not working.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=3361">56:01</a> that was a horrible joke üòÇ

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=560">9:20</a>
The best way to understand the APIs is to talk about the Windows APIs.<br>If I make a desktop Application in which the user will open files, save or save as...and print or share...<br>It will be insane to write into my application all the code needed to make new application &quot;Common User Dialogue interfaces&quot; that opens or saves as; or prints..Or shares......<br>why should I do that while Windows provides small programs and routines and common dialogue Boxes that can do all that?<br>And all I have to do is to summon them from windows system. <br>One to open Any file...An other to save as and choose the output extension...An other to open the Print page or share or copy paste...<br>It wood be insane to rewrite similar &quot;tools&quot; or &quot;routines&quot; or name&#39;em what ever you want... They&#39;re just simple &quot;APIs.&quot;<br>They are programs that Windows provides for himself first, And for all any other tiers or user&#39;s programmed apps; To make life more easy for All.<br>And those are just a few samples from a Long list of APIs that Windows and tiers offer, Like a drop of water from a big ocean.

You should really change the title of this video and add &quot;for MAC OS&quot; because it&#39;s not really for beginners if you&#39;re using windows. I managed to get most of the thing you did to work but it did take quite a bit of googling and doing extra thing that are not mentioned in the notes. Many people would just give up and watch something else as it does take time to make this work on windows and it take away from the learning flow.
you only needed to know how to set up your terminal. if you aren&#39;t willing to research that on your on then being a developer is not for you
Thanks
Oh well well that was fun!
The introduction is too LONG!!! he just talks and talks about so many issues!!! does not go into the concept of the course
Why does this dude looks like me. Beast!?
same <br>I&#39;m currently watching Dark(2017)<br>can&#39;t help but think he&#39;s mr beast himself from the future lol
I love the way you talk to me, makes me feel like I understood it (did I ?) üôÇ
This is my first foray into API programming. The expected changes to Spotify mentioned early in the video are quite apparent, as are considerable changes in Twilio, making the training difficult to follow. I&#39;m constantly having to pause the training to dig through the website to locate the relevant pages in order to follow the training path. The information contained is very thorough and appreciated but, it definitely needs a complete update.
Excellent introduction to APIs! üòÆ

You don&#39;t, just watch that part or you can skip to twillio if u want
it doesnt have console but you can get the same functionality in search but still , spotify isnt giving authorization bearer token . so got stuck at that point

also in the course of learning, it&#39;s a good idea to watch the video multiple times. i&#39;ll usually start each learning session with rewatching what i&#39;ve learned the day before. not only does it help for the knowledge to sink in but you pick up the bits you didn&#39;t pick up the first time. and sometimes a single word or sentence repeated is enough to commit something to memory for life. I&#39;m 54 years old, and have been a systems engineer my whole life, and have interacted with many API&#39;s, including the Twitter API, the Wordpress API, various gaming API&#39;s. I watch this sort of thing fairly regularly as computing is a fast moving field with many concepts learned either fading out with time, or replaced by newer technology. This is super important if you are currently working to keep abreast of emerging technologies you may need for upcoming projects or jobs.

Ayo mrbeast
All for one,one for all nice project
Personally after completing the whole course, i won&#39;t suggest this course to anyone who wants to learn about APIs seriously. It felt more like explanation of various API tools from the second chapter rather than actual API related knowledge.<br><br>It is still a good course with a practical approach in explanation and can be taken if a fun way of learning things is your style but not for when you need immediate information or binge learning.

Excellent introduction of API... Absolutely ‚ù§ the way it was taught..
This course is quite good, however it woul&#39;ve been better if it was focused for people who already know how to code because who the hell would try to learn APIs without coding knowledge

Spotify isn&#39;t a good example because it isn&#39;t available in my current region.<br>Telegram bot apis would be a better example.
This tutorial is exactly what I needed! Everything is explained so clearly, even for a beginner like me.I&#39;ve watched several API tutorials, but this one breaks it down in the most understandable way. Such a well-structured course! You made APIs seem a lot less intimidating than I thought

Hello, I&#39;m on the Spotify website and it&#39;s difficult to follow along because the UI change is much less visual and literally things are not at the same places. I can adapt. I just wanted to voice the difficulty as I might not be alone. I know it&#39;s frustrating to have a video you post hit so differently already the next year!

Why would you make such a big deal about inclusivity and then go call Mr. Knowles-Carter by his former name, not cool Big Poppa. You should know he hates that because how it went with his ID. Pick a message. I&#39;m not just quoting His Majesty Boyd G&#39;s new single. Second-newest, whatever, same thing.
if it&#39;s &quot;helpful&quot; to know intro coding and &quot;helpful&quot; to know how the web interface works, then I would REMOVE the word &quot;beginner&quot; from the title.
It&#39;s begginer for starting on API&#39;s. Of course you need to know the MOST BASIC STUFF about IT.

Dude! You are the perfect instructor!
Best api course ever! Really enjoyed the manner of Craig.
This video does a good job of answering questions I had roughly the same time I had them. Thats a tough tightrope to walk as an instructor and I really appreciated the consistency with which it happened. <br><br>I researched the Google trick and immediately got suspicious when he showed that we can essentially create bot accounts, and each one gets $15. Its nice when a person you can&#39;t ask questions of consistently answers them anyway.

Great vid, love it. I am having difficulty with all the demo&#39;s so far as non of them work the way you describe in the vid. Spotify now required you make a API APP to get the token, Twilio keeps giving me errors saying my phone number is not authenticated, so i havent been able to do the rest.
what do we do if the access token for spotify expires? (chapter 2, video 2)
OMGosh! he is an amazing presenter. Thanks Craig.
I really enjoyed the video, however the trial Twilio account did not work for me. Apparently Twilio now only issues toll free numbers for trial accounts and those numbers can only be verified by business entities. I reached out to support and was told the only workaround is to purchase a non toll free number.
Twilio exercise definitely didn&#39;t work :(
Is there any marketplace or place where we can go and find any API we want? (Eg: google,youtube,twitch) etcs
Here is what I want to know. Why do I every night wake up to your videos? I‚Äôm not subscribed. I‚Äôm not into coding. But subliminally YouTube is subconsciously forcing me. (Sense I‚Äôm asleep when it just decides to play this.)
I think you&#39;re gonna have to update Spotify part... Other than that, amazing indeed! Thanks a lot.
Did the spotify part worked for you
@monickverma2944 nope :(
I wish this guy didn&#39;t sound so damn annoying....
Your lecture was interesting, it was fun and I&#39;m sure it was very helpful by many people&#39;s comments.<br>I feel like I still didn&#39;t grasp 100% of what you talked about the first time. I may need to review it many times. Thanks for the useful video! ü•∞

Sorry, this video is outdated.
Why?
@matheuscastelo5076 follow the tutorial and you gonna see why
I guess so, could you suggest a newer one for me. I‚Äôm struggling to understand the whole API, backend stuff
Know quick: the Spotify developers page changed and now you cannot get the token.
This looks like nothing  more than twilio sponsored video
so i need a break every 15 mins, i wouldn&#39;t get anything done this way

Don&#39;t use Spotify as a resource. The console is gone now. This video needs to be updated again without the use of Spotify.
Its a little different now but you can still perform the same requests he&#39;s demonstrating.
what are api for?

Mr Beast - Teach Mode
Man.. most of the middle of the video was about SMS but in Turkey, I could not get a message from Twilio... Sad but True
WHAT THE HELLLL
That is not working at all, I cannot find the OAuth in the official website of Spotify, which disable other operations
I love those jokes. Hilarious. Thanks, Craig
Not a fan of this long-winded tutorial at all.<br><br>Also, injecting unfunny &quot;humor&quot; and silliness throughout the tutorial does not help your audience.
Great video.<br><br>Spotify have updated their dev page and now it&#39;s quite hard to get the OAuth token (it&#39;s not as simple as in the video) Would be good if the notes have this in mind
I found a post from spotify community --&gt; Web API Reference &quot;Get Token&quot; button where they give you a working solution
how to get it now?? pls help
@AkxshKrishnamoorthy Yeah I am unable to do so too
How can I get the ConversationSId
I can&#39;t get the full REQUEST SAMPLE from the new spotify page
So good, I sent myself an email link for future viewing üòÅ

nice explanation!!! thank you sir.!!!
What are the best pre-requisite videos to watch before this one ‚Äî to cover the basics he mentioned toward the beginning?
What does this mean? &quot;NOTE: If you are running PowerShell, delete the curl alias for Invoke-WebRequest by adding the following command to your profile (C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1):&quot;
By default, Windows Power Shell has an alias set up for curl which maps &quot;curl&quot; to a different command. You can get around this by either following the note, or by explicitly typing curl.exe instead of curl when running curl commands in PowerShell.
what is that device @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4468">1:14:28</a>
Spotify console has moved to a &quot;console like&quot; page at the home page. This TUT looks great but hard to follow in 2024,,,
you use your computer terminal during the spotify API section.. Curl runs on mac without any install
why is this guys so good at explaining this
&quot;Ahoy World!&quot; :)
Too much noise. Stick to the topic and stop story telling. Too much time wasted.
this is the most amazing video

Hello , I&#39;m Craig and I&#39;m a developer. My age is 24 *with a face of an old person
This educator immediately reminds me of my favourite teacher of all time. I was 14 in 9th grade in New Delhi, and the teacher was Mr Atri and he taught us Mathematics. An absolutely brilliant man, and an amazingly intriguing teacher who taught me mathematical concepts, that I still remember to this day, and I&#39;m almost 35 years old now.
Appreciate the pokemon reference at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=1459">24:19</a> mark for &quot;gotta collect (catch) them all&quot;
50 minutes in, how do I get the Authorization token to paste in curl format?
Did you get yeh token
I could not find it either
@shifasheikh9261 No. They&#39;ve changed their website.
chop a bulk of knowledge into pieces, lecture then make lil bit fun respectively. I can tell you make me fully focus on ur vid. Thank you sir <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc"></a>

Unfortunately I was unable to do the Twilio part as Twilio has blocked my account right after registration. They sent me an email asking to provide the reason why I&#39;m using their service. After my honest reply that I&#39;m just learning API and a reference to this video, they said they couldn&#39;t restore my account because my &quot;use case is not supported by their service&quot;. The video is still very useful and easy to watch, thank you!
You are Wonderful! Thank You for blessing Us all with Your wisdom and Expertise.

I don&#39;t know how to code yet. I am a bit lost in this video. Yes, he dresses it up nicely .. but .. not sure if he is really happy in all that mess. Maybe he is.
this dude is saul goodman
I&#39;m so hyped, and that teacher hypes me even more! Explations superb!
Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much, you are a fantastic teacher!

Great teacher, but I wish so many of the examples weren&#39;t done with something so &quot;connected.&quot; Tons of verification required for using Twilio, which really slows things down. Twilio verification changes in November 2023 made it impossible to actually execute those examples as a hobbyist/student. If you&#39;ve got some experience in development, you can adapt these examples as needed; but for novices it may be a bit more difficult to follow along than was promised.
Yeah, I can&#39;t use the Twilio or the Spotify example. Do you have any other sites that offer similar dev resources to test with?
I am using Windows 11 and I can not see any of the Spotify stuff you are teaching, it only work on MAC OS?
Worked up to 4ku on codewars learning to functionally program around small isolated problems and then ran into an API project and have no idea where to start. Forums and searches led me here. It&#39;s weird feeling like you learned something only to realize you can&#39;t do anything useful with it. Hoping this video helps! (edit on the way).

So API = function?
Woke agenda in this tutorial!
This is great!! I am struggling in the Spotify part with the Oauth, like Dennis mentioned, the UI has changed in the dev section. <br>Has anyone been successful with the Oauth part? I keep getting a 400 error.
@daverobertson8138 did you get the OAuth Token?? Where did you get it from
@shifasheikh9261 they require you to create an app ID to get an OAuth token now. I recommend skipping that part of the video.
Definitely a tutorial to watch for learning with immersive experience.
I do like the fact that freecodecamp gives us these informations for free BUT I just can&#39;t stop getting annoyed by the fact that Craig Dennis used twillio api which is the company that he works for. It&#39;s like promoting yourself. I would not care if it was a free api but it is not and it&#39;s not worth the hassle. Don&#39;t get me wrong in anyway I am grateful for this course but wish he would have used a free api which would give us a tool in our repository instead of an api we will only use for 10 - 15 messages give or take.

This video was amazing, great, just great, thanks fcc and Craig for your dedication.
Hey someone please tell what are the preliminary requirements before starting to learn this. I am a beginner (non IT ) have some understanding in networking and python programming
What a messed up video
I can use Kali Linux apps can i programm
10mins into the course but I have to thank him for making learning so fun, he&#39;s a really good teacher!
Very informative! thank you !
for those wondering what was that on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=622">10:22</a>:<br><br>it&#39;s in ruby language, <br>chr(ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20):<br><br>1. ord(&#39;y&#39;) : The `ord` method in Ruby returns the ASCII code of the character passed to it. In this case, `ord(&#39;y&#39;)` returns the ASCII code for the character &#39;y&#39;, which is 121.<br><br>2. 0x20 : This represents the hexadecimal value 20, which is equivalent to 32 in decimal.<br><br>3. `^` (XOR operator): The XOR (exclusive OR) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of two numbers.<br><br>4. ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20 This bitwise XOR operation is performed between the ASCII code of &#39;y&#39; (121 in decimal) and 32. The result is 89.<br><br>5. chr(89):  The `chr` method in Ruby converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character. In this case, `chr(89)` returns the character with the ASCII code 89, which is &#39;Y&#39;.<br><br>So, the overall expression `chr(ord(&#39;y&#39;) ^ 0x20)` takes the character &#39;y&#39;, performs a bitwise XOR with 32, resulting in the ASCII code 89, and then converts that ASCII code back to the character &#39;Y&#39;.
Well done for the info. I like how you broke it down into pieces for better explanation.
This also works with Python
Also the old video showed Python at that part so it is NOT RUBY
When I first started programming, I really couldn&#39;t understand XOR or its purpose. Wish I read this back then
I can&#39;t stop the video üòÆüòÇ

waste of time
Curl for Spotify doesn&#39;t work for me. I have &#39;invalid access token&#39; error. Why?
DI (Developer Interface-as opposed to UI) is better than API.
I wish your video will also be available in multiple languages like Hindi. I find difficult in understanding in English.
I cannot verify my number at twiio, what should I do?
Amazing course ! I&#39;ve purchased a course from Udemy that I followed during days and didn&#39;t understand APIs to be honest. But this video made a lot of things very clear

This API course is interesting and funny.
I got a project to manage APIs and this course helped me sooo much to better understand what am I getting myself into üòÇ. Thank you soooo much!
Great Course! I was trying to follow along with the Spotify example, and I cannot find the Spotify Web API console. I found a post in the Spotify community where someone was asking where the console was, but there was no response. Does anyone know how to access the console if it is still available?
I ran into the same issue. did you figure it out?
@payambabakhanlou7145I‚Äôd skip Spotify, they changed the interface. You also need an app id if you want to get access.
Unfortunately it looks like Spotify have changed their web developer user interface (in the UK at least) and the process for getting started with using Spotify&#39;s API is very different to how it looks in this tutorial. There is no longer a console that you can access from your browser, you have to install multiple &quot;packages&quot; locally on your machine.<br><br>Spotify have made a tutorial (spread over a dizzying number of hyperlinked pages) to build an app. So in order to do the first tutorial for this video which requires the console, I went through some of the process (not knowing what I was installing or what I was doing) to try and get a command line environment that accesses Spotify&#39;s API, and eventually gave up. It didn&#39;t seem like that process was going to get me to a point where I could do the exercise in the video! :( <br><br>Maybe Spotify view having their own tutorial as an even more accessible developer environment, but it made following this video impossible for me.
i also have the same problem and i&#39;m really frustrated to be honest
Same@gabirilwan1987 Really frustrating I finally found a course with a teacher that seems great and none of it works.
Thanks!

Xerox (PARC) is perhaps one the most underrated companies/organizations in our history, being one of the most innovative, yet most would rather believe that Apple is at frontier of pioneerism. But did they invent ethernet? The GUI? The computer mouse? The desktop interface? Object-oriented programming language? How about the laser printer? All they have done is steal IP
Youre superior for creating this hosting video! Ive experimented with HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupn is the best cash saver.
I was summonded for jury duty on the day I was supposed to start a new gig.  I had to explain what an API was to the judge.  My little wheels were churning so I didn&#39;t sound condescending but explained it enough.  I came up with the Rosetta Stone translations that couldn&#39;t all be stored on a phone so API calls from a little phone app would be made to a website or cloud repository.
Thanks for the amazing video!
Awesome and Lively presentation

Thank you so much for this course! It&#39;s very well made, useful and better than some paid courses I have seen.
Craig Dennis is awesome!
Best teacher everrrr
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=3355">55:55</a> did end up being so funny because i zoned out and back in and you were still talking about &#39;who runs the terminal&#39; curl beyonce link. ha but i wont forget that link now either.
When I copy the request sample from Spotify, it&#39;s not working in CMD
Spotify not providing AuthToken anymore, I just followed the steps...
Always showing No token provided or Invalid Access token. How can I generate this... This is getting annoying
Did you find a solution? I have the same problem. Maybe all next parts of this course will consist old not working stuff, I dunno<br><br>Btw, looks like there are really few guys, including us, who trying to do it with course&#39;s author, that&#39;s interesitng
@Den1sNovikov no, I didn&#39;t.<br><br>I didn&#39;t continue the course as well due to frustration
Thankyou So much.
Thanks for the good web hosting knowledge! Ive examined HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupon is the budget-friendly selection.
spotify console is no longer here so following along is really hard
i cant get an accces token to run the code in my terminal !!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2626">43:46</a> just here to say that the line on Beyonce taking the API dev to red lobster wasn&#39;t lost in the crack, clever wordplay ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=2578">42:58</a>
who runs the terminal?
you are or Male or Female. thats it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=575">9:35</a> APIs are like functions that could be called over the internet.
I think the API is updated, and now to get the token, we must already create our app, to get the token :(
Exploring Spotify API and my token is being shortened.. How can I fix that.
My curl get request isn&#39;t working in the terminal..everything seems to have changed since the time upload of this course... The token is incomplete. How can I fix that
I couldn&#39;t get the Twillio command line code to work, and kept giving the error message that no credentials provided. Twillo must have changed regarding using a test account in command line, because the support materials state that &quot;Twilio test credentials will not work with Twilio CLI&quot;. Otherwise, I agree that this is a good course. I know things do not remain the same and get changed sometimes.
Did anyone have any issues trying to find Console on Spotify. Wanted to follow along but I guess Spotify updated and I could not follow along
The Spotify dev page has changed considerably and feel its extremely difficult to follow this class now.
I don&#39;t know why but this guy is look like old Mr.Beastü•≤
Lmao that&#39;s exactly what I thought
Craig looks like Mr beast grandpa

Spotify has changed their api docs. There isn&#39;t a console anymore.
Most WOKE teacher ever. Why is he apologizing after making EVERY pun. If you&#39;re so embarrassed after making it, just don&#39;t make it. Ruined all the fun of those pins with his followed apology.
@app.post(&quot;/API&quot;)<br>async def post_comment():<br>    return JSONResponse(status_code:200, content=&quot;fCC you rock!&quot;)
I can&#39;t do the Spotify Web API from my terminal because it hides the access token. Even when i hit the copy button on spotify, it still doesn&#39;t give me the complete token and then says &quot;invalid access token&quot; for the error reason. The interface has changed quite a bit since this video. There wasn&#39;t anywhere to create the token, and it certainly doesn&#39;t look like the one in the video. So none of this works for me.
hi Bro i have the same problem the the user interface changed and console link not availble
You cannot - prove any API - with TTY!
The course is going great so far... One thing though, how do I get the Oauth token from Spotify&#39;s api from their updated website? That has been an issue.
This guy has the maximum value of charisma üòÑ

pretty good job thanks!
Huge thanks to Craig Dennis and FreeCodeCamp! This is truely an amazing and helpful video!

I love your teaching style!  Makes it less daunting to learn --- I did get stuck on the Twilio example, when I ran the curl code in <a href="http://colab.google/">colab.google</a>, it returned a SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal - I tried to figure it out but it was over head.  I tried to find that darn decimal and could not.  Any direction would help, please. Otherwise, thank you for taking the time to make this for us who need it!
that video is very informative helped me a lot to understand Api&#39;s
Ok, at this point I need to donate or something, because this is such high quality educational content.
This is one of the most playful and fun tutorial freeCodeCamp has ever added.
The spotify developer CONSOLE isn&#39;t currently available from Jan 2023...<br>Please update the course :)
Very good content by the way!! I found it hard to learn elsewhere the new tech since last 13 years. Recently I got my visa approved for Canada and I m looking to move there. I heard they have more requirement for this skillset in combination with mainframe. Could you please elaborate how mainframe use restapi as a front end. I think I heard you saying api is always backend so what is my company implying by using backend data with involvement of z/os connect and postman. We use 3270 mainframe systems and 3270 online (front end system). I heard they implemented  a system fix by using Cics cobol program by sending some data to Cics and that data I guess was pulled by z/os somehow and it was getting rendered on a website in form of something. Looked like someone created a restapi services using postman and this new api was accessing data from what was printed on a Cics job running in queue online during the day when the developer test his changes which is sort of making sense now.can you help me understand if I m understanding it right ?
Dude, you saying too many pointless words in between, that i just cant follow the course!

do you guys have a discord community where you can interact with  other programmers on your project?
Sir can I become your student
Man, the asynchronous js I learned a month ago finally synced in when I watched the video 6. THAT&#39;S HOW IT WORKS!!!!! Awesome tutorial.
30 minutes in, and I&#39;m still not sure what an API is.
So essentially it‚Äôs code that take input from the front end and it send the data in a specific format like json to the backend( the server). Then the server responds with with a http code and with the data that you requested I think in json. And the type of api most commonly use is RestApi and Graphql. Also api are used to provide the data of your application to other application. So if I want info from twitter like profile info, likes, posts etc then I need to get twitter api functions to request the data I want.last thing: why api are important? It allows apps to use data from another app and integrate it into their own apps! üòÆ

Feedback: Please mention about windows not needing the backslashes in the terminal earlier. You mention it around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=4050">1:07:30</a> when it would have been better to mention it before actually copying and pasting cURL stuff into the terminal

I made sure that curl is installed. It is)<br>What am I doing wrong?<br><br>Edit: Nevermind I got it to work. Its a bit annoying that the text editor I&#39;m using (Notepad++) to post the copied code into first to be able to make changes to the parameters, doesn&#39;t allow me to copy and paste the code from the text editor to the terminal.

Great course, the teacher explain very good each content
Thank you I am trying to catch up on technology enough to understand what is being said. Everything is connected to, used by, or based on other things, codes, protocols... okay that list could go on. But the only thing I knew about API&#39;s was that my WordPress needed one and I have to update mine every once in a while. I knew it was a type of identifier but that was all. Then I started hearing more talk about API&#39;s in the talks on AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Very well explained sir. I have loved the examples. Thanks so much!

An excellent instructor explaining a not so easy topic
This is cringey. I&#39;ll find API tutorials elsewhere.
Your beatboxing is atrociously cool <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
now spotify has changed it&#39;s developer options , i can&#39;t get it&#39;s Oauth token
same here idk how to get a token. Have you done any solution?
@yoayis none , I am clueless about it
@bluebon5228 aight appreciate ya brotha
Thank you

Anyone else having trouble in Unit 2, using Restfox for that first POST lesson.  I keep getting error
Hi, Why cant we see the developers option in Spotify , when I try I don&#39;t see a developers option mentioned in video !
Thank you, Chris Hardwick&#39;s doppelganger. Only a third of the way through but I&#39;m enjoying it!
Can&#39;t get Authorization by Spotify. Who cam help me to get it ?
It was a good start till the interface in api was explained. But after that I find it difficult to follow as a beginner in this field. It was very much engaging though. Would have been better if things were made simpler to understand.
You guys are amazing what a great job ‚ù§
Is there a summary of this course? Why does using API need a 3 hour video? Just get the key and Read the Manual on using the proper tools and parameters??
Yeah it&#39;s in the description
I mean the key points from each of his units/videos. Description is just the outline/overview which of course I saw
Can anyone help me, where can I find notes for this course ?
tommorrow i have to submit my final year CS project Synopsis , and here i am learning APIs  , what can i do
Hi, Thank you for the great tutorial,. I have a question, do I need to have a premium account to follow your tutorial? because I don&#39;t get the option &quot;Get Token&quot;
The developer page has changed, and I am having trouble with the OAuth/token any tips or help would be greatly appreciated
Awesome
This is SOOO good! Thank you for this awesome course! I feel the power!
the only thing i achieved from this video was confusion . it was too cumbersome and i just found it really hard to grasp
Im getting empty message but i followed all the steps @1.25mins. The response was 200 which is sucessful but my message was empty. I need help please.
Are you talking about minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=10473">2:54:33</a>? Because im stuck at that point and dont know if you figured it out
so frustrating - MAJOR issues with accessing the Spotify web api via Terminal. They changed the whole dev interface. I keep getting 401 errors when I take the code from Spotify to my terminal.

unable to find console in spotify
Spotify Web API Reference is changed and now that whole part of the course isn&#39;t so easy to follow --- cant get curl to work right with the samples they give, nor do I think spotify so freely gives out the key code in terms of ease of access

This is excellent. I followed through from start till finish nobody could make developing and programming easier than this beautiful piece of tutorial. Thank you for your sincere effort to helping others. I will watch over and over until I am able to independently build APIs and consume same.

API is not an acronym; it&#39;s an initialism.
maybe an interesting course, but spotify changed, twilio tells me, my (german) phone-verification-number is expired (5 sec after receiving ), for me it makes no sence to continue. Who knows what will be after 1 or  2 hours learning. Not happy :(
For the windows user, I&#39;d suggest using gitbash instead of the command prompt. That way, the commands used in cURL are the same just like mac and linux.
üòÇ I have been stuck on this part for an hour trying to get it to work.<br>Thanks!

@mando6707 are you using command prompt, gitbash, or another terminal?

Came here because everything in the cloud is an API call. Anyway don&#39;t mind me just making myself some notes:<br><br>Interfaces provide a way of using/interacting with sth<br>API allow programs/programmers to use stuff without knowing the implementation for common enough tasks
The teacher earns my attention from the first second. this video was recommended by youtube and i am so excited! I am learning python, and why not to take a course on api&#39;s by a great instructor? so excited! Your students and your family must be proud of you. I have take so many online courses, i have to say you have the best way of teaching. Thank you

What should i watch first https method video or this API one
But where is the developer console? Has it been renamed or what? I&#39;m stuck.
Hey everyone, unfortunately he is right about the Spotify page being different. Problem is, they&#39;ve removed the ability to generate authentication tokens and curl statements in the browser and while still possible, it&#39;s a much more difficult process. I&#39;d recommend just watching the Spotify part and then jumping in at the Twilio part.
That makes sense! You said it&#39;s still possible to generate the tokens in the browser, how do you do that? I have been stuck on this step for over a week now. Thanks.
@Rentaplace Sorry, I meant that it&#39;s been removed from the browser and you have to generate your authentication token externally, making the request in your language/tool of choice. The nice thing is, I would not linger on the Spotify part. The very next API he teaches, Twilio, has it&#39;s authentication token available in the browser and then he shows tools like Postman that will show you how to go back to Spotify and make that authentication token. Just watch and do the rest of the video and then come back and do the tougher Spotify part after, you will know 100% how to handle it.
Thanks, I decided to come to the comments to see if other people had trouble with the changes to spotify.
@Runeblade484 I&#39;m stuck here don&#39;t know how to generate the API token. How did you get it?
@MrHoboninjapirate Thank you for saying this! I&#39;ve been struggling here for a bit trying to get an auth token and thought it was me.

just 10 min into this video and I fell in love with his teaching. WOW
great tutorial, I&#39;ve had fun the whole time while learning but I&#39;m trying to use Twilio and phone number verification is not going through, I am in Nigeria, please is there a workaround for this challenge?
Good teacher, bad course material!<br>- Spotify API is changing so fast, that I could not find the curl requests you show on the current Spotify site.<br>- Twilio might be a cool website, but no way I give my Number and E-Mail to try it. <br>- You explained really good at the start, but then you started talking mostly about the company you work for (twilio) and things that are not important.<br><br>Honest review: 2 of 10, and 2 is only for the sense of humor...
do you suggest any other courses ?
This course is amazing, but since it was creating Spotify recently updated their entire Developers section and the console is missing entirely and I can&#39;t figure out how to get the oauth token. <br>Anyone figured this out yet?
I second this. It seems like it no longer uses curl at all, and the page is now the ugliest shade of purple, although that may not be relevant.
You have to create an app and then use a language like Javascript to send a request for the token and then manually assemble your own curl statement unfortunately. It&#39;s complicated enough to no longer be &quot;beginner&quot; friendly so I&#39;d recommend just watching that part and jump in at the Twilio section or trying a different API tutorial.
@MrHoboninjapirate this is what I ended up doing actually
@MrHoboninjapirate Ah I see. I wasted too much time on this.
its okay
Great tutorial, but sadly Console is gone with Spotify. :(
Hey folks, can I know what has been deprecated?
I love this class! Anyone else getting a 502 Error for the Twilio Developer Documentation?
I just cant understand how to use curl with windows!!
if gender is not a problem, why did they ask
Craig is a very fun and enjoyable instructor, but this whole video is pretty much a <i>_</i> Twilio ad___<br><br> I signed up and used it once to send SMS, but not likely to use it again. I did watch whole video, made notes.
Amazing way of teaching!!

Is this the best teacher I&#39;ve ever come across? ü§î<br>Yes it definitely is! I love this man. Made learning so funful and enjoyable. You just can&#39;t skip any part. I rewind when I miss a single statement. Thanks a bunch for letting him teach. ‚ù§
spotify changed its configuration completely and now i am completely lost .... :) seems waaaayyy more complicated to get a token ! i am sooo lost omg :(
Same. I cant even find the console.
Same. I tried creating an app and using the Client Secret under Setting -&gt; Basic Information. Still getting a Token error in command prompt.
is it just me or it IS impossible to go on Twilio ? i have been trying to create an account multiple time with different email and everytime i try to sign in the page refresh over and over again and tell e there is an error. i did try to reply to trilio&#39;s message when they sent an email about verifying my identity to protect them of fraud but they never replied back ! and my account is still blocked ! and when i try to create a new account it does the same thing again!
I suffer the same problem. remove the &quot;+ ... &quot; behind your email in register
@whps51205  i didnt put the + sign and it still didnt let me
I have no idea how to request oauth token from this new Spotify UI. It seems like we are required to have an app with URI provided. Anyone has any clue?
I just typed something random in there. I managed to get a Client Secret. I&#39;m not 100% sure if its the same thing as a token. I&#39;m guessing not because I keep getting a token error in command prompt.
the guy is a truly righteous and son of god, he deserves heaven
You are a brilliant and gifted educator. Thank you
bruhhh, this guy is soo fun.
I have not decided if this is a good course or not. For instance, I thought the speaker was saying &#39;restbox&#39;. There is a &#39;restbox&#39; out there but does not do what his did. I played him saying it over and over. After reading the notes, I learned he was saying &#39;restfox&#39;. He needs to speak SLOWER and enunciate clearly. One should not have to rewind over and over again just to get a simple point.

This course has been an incredibly fruitful experience for me, and I can confidently say that it&#39;s one of the best things I&#39;ve ever done in my life. As someone who has been programming for almost a decade, gaining a deep understanding of how APIs work has taken my skills to a whole new level.
<br>
<br>I&#39;m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course, and I want to express my appreciation to those who made it possible. This is exactly how education should be: interactive, engaging, and straight to the point. The practical, hands-on approach of the course has allowed me to learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively, and I&#39;m confident that the knowledge I&#39;ve gained will prove invaluable in my future endeavors. Thank you again for creating such a fantastic learning experience.
HA. A decade. I started to learn coding JS and scratched some html and css since a month ago and whenever i meet a new term like i did with API i take a course.<br>I can not help myself to not know things while i do something and i think it will be my doom in the programming world as i got the feel it would take me forever to grasp all the concepts and terminology..
Yeah can you explain the upper() is method or api <br>In this course he said that to change to upper we all need is api

Thank you so much. I learned a lot about APIs from this course.
1 - This such a great great class, I&#39;m following everything and learning gobs since I&#39;ve been out of the programming world for 10 years.
<br>2 - Small issue on setting up RestFox to send the DVD picture.  No matter what I did it would not send.  My final troubleshooting step was to send a very small picture, and that worked.
<br>Is there a size restriction causing an issue or am I using the wrong URL?  What is the URL?  It is not in the notes...
<br>3 - The notes for Unit 2 Video 4 are very very sparse, can they be touched up?
Same issue here, can&#39;t seem to send an image. Even tried a 1kb jpeg but no joy
@dannykryan To be clear, I was able to send the much smaller cloud picture.<br>I set up the entire request and sent with an unchecked the MediaUrl (which worked), checked the MediaURL (which failed), then unchecked the MediaUrl and  resent again (which worked).  This proved that the issue was the MediaUrl and it alone.<br>Then I chose a much smaller picture, that worked...<br>I think case matters so MediaURL is not good, you have to use MediaUrl.
spotify apis are only available for the US, UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia markets ??
I got completely lost at Unit 2 Video 4 @ postman/rest fox....I guess I&#39;ll give your first video tutorial I see others mentioning a try
Perfect video for API, thanks, Dennis!

I learned about this concept in school but it was only briefly covered in a database class and I never understood the point of it until my last job. They were manually configuring hundreds of appliance-type devices through their web UI&#39;s which took hours of work. One small change request was many more hours of work again. I realized that these appliances had an API and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of IP&#39;s and sent API commands to each device in the list. I did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half. <br><br>As someone who is in IT but is not a developer, even I could see the enormous power and potential of the API. It opens the door to automation, which reduces human error dramatically. It also speeds up onboarding. I am looking forward to watching this course and learning more about API&#39;s and their other uses.
How do you know how to write scripts? I&#39;m not a developer and have no idea how to write scripts.

WOW !!! Your Voice sounds like All THREE STOOGES wrapped into one with all sort of Up and down range in tone.  You gloss over a plethora of terms and really explain NONE of the actual terms and yet you think we should somehow know what you are talking about FOR BEGINNERS .  Perhaps all of your FRIENDS who commented here to boost your rating or Seasoned Programmers who have already a good general understanding of all this UNDERSTANDS what you are talking about.  I have watched the first 30 minutes  3 TIMES IN A ROW ( thats an hour and a half of Gibberish ) and I have NO IDEA ZERO IDEA of what you are even talking about.

Thanks fro this toturaial to API. üòã
The Teacher Is Very Energetic, Joyful and Good At Teaching. Attracts People&#39;s Attention Without Boring Them. I Enjoyed His Teaching Style.
Thank you very much, a very good job. I hope to learn more about API and this is a good beginning.
she might take the api down to red lobster !

jq is not just working on  my windows laptop
Am I misunderstanding something or you need an American phone number to be able to send to your Twilio phone number in the trial and follow along with this?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=840">14:00</a> ..... Is that a radio with a 8 track ??
Pretty rad right?! You can find all sorts of stuff in the prop room!
This is a great course ü•∞ .... but the problem i face all the time is that Twilio restrict me from getting a Twilio number ....My first account suspended by them after 1 second i created it......  After that I created another account with another email but they restrict me from  getting a Twilio number.... Also no replies to emails...Now i am stressed ü§ïabout this struggle...I was not able continue this course for two days because this issue... Feel like to give up this tutorialüò•....is there a alternative to Twilio for following this course?
WATCH THIS VIDEO YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!! Such an amazing teacher! Thank you for such a wonderful course!
When I open the url for &quot;who runs the world&quot; search in the browser, it just opens the Beyonc√© page, but not the song itself. I noticed that when he does the first search at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=3286">54:46</a>, even though it brings up the wrong artist page, the Beyonc√© song is there already at the bottom of the page - I guess because that‚Äôs the last song played on his Spotify profile. So that when he then puts in the correct url at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&amp;t=3340">55:40</a>, it brings up Beyonc√©‚Äôs main page, but the same song is still there. Did anyone else have this happen to them and did you manage to show the correct track that was searched for? The url itself seems to only refer to the artist, but not the search for the track. Thank you!
I love it when you call me big poppa hahahahahahahahahaha üòÇ
pls i need help. when using the spotify API, the api  testing result on the spotify for developer website   is different from  that of  my vscode terminal testing result

Love learning API from Mr.Beastüëå
even the voice haha
best API course on YouTube
this course was brilliantly taught..
Ok ChatGPT, explain this to me as if you were Craig Dennis ü•∞
First off Carlos, you&#39;ve got this! Take your time learning XYZ, and remember at some point everyone has to learn it too. This might be a bug in the AI, but you got this! üí™üöÄ
Best!
I love this guy&#39;s charisma
Thank you for this lecture.
this whole course feels a bit condescending
Oh no I&#39;m sorry it came across that way for you! I actively try to avoid this. I appreciate your feedback. If you could let me know more about this, I&#39;d love to dig into it, so I can avoid making others feel this way. I apologize for making you feel this way!
Please make a course on laravel üò≠üò≠üò≠
Super insightful course. Thanks Craig and freeCodeCamp.
I want Craig Dennis to teach me all the hard things in life: explain clearly and positively, tell me that it&#39;s okay to pause, give yourself time, be patient - these are important steps in any new businessüëèüëèüëè
Hi Elena.. Are you a Web-Developer?
I want a Oracle sql and plsq.
Lost patience at the cringing worship of Spotify, and downvoted. Brands are not your friends and being a good consoomer shouldn&#39;t be mistaken for  being a good developer.
Getting back inteRESTing data back from an API. Very clever. üôÇ
This was fun :D
Thank you for making this free, I feel such great gratitude! ^^
Good one!
How about I have a DHIS2 database and it doesn&#39;t have an exposed API to consume the data stored in the DHIS2. How then do you create an API to consume the data. I was thinking this is what this tutorial will be addressing and not the conventional API tutorials.
I dont know why you thought it would be advanced. The  title does say APIs for beginners. You could also have looked at the details or the comments posting the thumbnails.
Are you using Terminal on mac? The part where you typed jq and changed colors nothing happened for me.
Fixed it.  Needed to install JQ from Brew
How does he look better than 3 years ago. Kek
Three minutes into the video and I&#39;ve learned absolutely nothing about api. I doubt the next three hours will be any better. Time to cut my losses...
Thanks for taking the time to comment!
I love how he teaches this guy, he reminds me of Jesse from Breaking Bad. I have understood things and learned new concepts so I see the light! Thanks!
I just want to let him know that I actually laughed at the &#39;who runs the terminal? curl&#39; joke. dad jokes ftw
Your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dadjoke">#dadjoke</a> feedback has been received. Thank you!
Congratulations
This is the course that actually thought me how to work with API&#39;s
I ran the same code and it returned an external URL for Rihanna&#39;s artist page. No matter which way I try it, it won&#39;t return Beyonce. Weird. Not sure what I did wrong or how it keeps connecting Rihanna from Beyonce. I don&#39;t normally listen to either so it&#39;s certainly not some stray data throwing it off.
Absolutely love the tone and approach to this course, and thank you for making this free!
Thank you.
Wish this was written with python
| jq <br>doesn&#39;t work on my computer üòÇüòÇ
What Operating System ?
Thanks for this awesome tutorial
Amazing teacher ‚ù§Ô∏è üëè
Please add advance modern backend development with Nodejs and Mongodb, redis with advanced aggregation and all useful npm packages
Is replit based on API? As we can see all the server code running on browser
I could use an API to abstract away the &quot;cutesy&quot; parts of this presentation which would cut it down at least 40% of the distractive nonsense based on what I&#39;ve seen so far. I also acknowledge that this could be valuable for some people,  but not me.
I appreciate your feedback, and also appreciate you thinking about how others might need it. I hope it&#39;s not too much! Once you get out of conceptual town, I let the code keep interest. I&#39;m still dorky unfortunately üòÖ
@7footmoustache Thank you both for the above perspectives. At times even I felt like the whole video could be condensed to 60pc of what it is now,  but later I realized there are people who actually benefit from the leisurely pace of learning. Thank you Craig for the amazing video.

‚Äã@7footmoustache It&#39;s always exciting finding the solution to the error lol. <br><br>I hope there are intermediate videos to come. :) Thanks for everything.
It kind of starts 5 minutes in
2 minutes into the course and already &#39;I&#39;m Lovin It&#39;
i can&#39;t belive i just saw this video for free. you guys are incredible
Great video up until the point we are messing with VS Code. I can not, for the life of me, make it work in Windows. I get error after error after error in the terminal (PowerShell) even after following your docs on the description for Windows.
Thank you for the feedback Jo√£o I&#39;ll work on a screen cast to add to the notes
I would like to thank you here from Brazil üáßüá∑

HI. It is good tutorial but what about those who use Windows? It have encountered so many issues just running the VScode...
Oh no Pavel, I&#39;m sorry! What problems did you run into? I&#39;ll update the notes. The rest of the course shouldn&#39;t matter as it&#39;s browser based.
@7footmoustache hi! For example when I wanted to create the variables for the twilio ID and password. I adjusted the commands for Windows but it still gives me error that username is required
Huge thx‚ù§
Apart the cringe humor, he is very charismatic and fluid explaining things. Thanks for the video!
Thanks for the feedback! Sorry for the cringe!
@7footmoustache The cringe humor was my favorite part. Here for it! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
I&#39;d prefer that Spotify not ask gender.  Why do they care about that?  It&#39;s not being inclusive.  It&#39;s intrusive marketing.  Don&#39;t be naive.
Amazing video.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
&quot;Education isn&#39;t meant to be binged and because of this, I&#39;ll probably remind you quite a bit to take breaks.&quot; ~ The best quote I&#39;ve heard today.
Gap learning is great
So far, this video was done RIGHT, and anyone that watches it knows exactly what I mean.
Paused at 4m to get a burrito. Looks great so far though!
I wonder if they are allowed to say &quot;HE wrote the code&quot; xD
Cause statistically it&#39;s more likely to be HIM lmao
Fabulous course! Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
The instructor looks like mrbeast&#39;s fatherüëÄ
This video is amazing. I can listen to this guy all day. Thank you very much
üî•üî•
Detailed Explanations! Great Course for beginners
Thank you so much for this üôèüôå‚ù§Ô∏è
This is really very excited to me and the host is awesome and the interaction with people is woow
Thank you so much sirü§ù Your work is very impressiveüëç‚ù§
May I get a suggestion on how to Create an API?
There are multiple ones on this channel, using Python, Django, .Net, Fastapi
I was just watching the old version. Great to have a more detailed version
Thank you so much for sharing this with us on YouTube ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• from Kyoto üáØüáµ <br><br>His API course is hands down the most accessible and life-changing for dummies like me
Definitely not for beginners and I haven&#39;t learned that much, only a few key words like REST, CRUD, CURL, POSTMAN and the course has taken 3 hours of my life...<br>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re using Twilio as everything... you said Postman is complicated, Twilio is on a next level of &#39;complicated&#39;...<br>Why not use Visual Studio Code and start from scratch using only this editor and show us how to start and finish A WORKING PROJECT. You&#39;re trying to teach about an API. So start a project in VSC, take a dad jokes API as an example and teach us how everything works. The main objective to use an API is for a website to be interactive and right now I don&#39;t even know how to implement an API on a website so I can extract a user&#39;s custom query and show that data on a website as a result...<br><br>That&#39;s the problem with tutorials right now, they&#39;re very long and not practical unfortunately.
I feel you. I&#39;ve been self studying Web dev for about 6 months. Needed a refresher on basic API and while this was enjoyable, im not sure I learned anything and took me way longer than 3 hours! Who is this for?
dude you‚Äôre such an awesome instructor. i hope to one day be like you!
I just finish his old api course, now there&#39;s an updated one?
I really love this man&#39;s energy he makes learning not feel cumbersome at all
Wow this is the kind of teacher that inspires me the most! Thank you
I haven&#39;t made it through this yet, but this is very good.  Great work
The best video about API
Very fun and cool, I will finish it by tomorrow to have a total understanding of API before using it
Craig&#39;s videos always radiate warmth
ü§ó
The production quality here is amazing.
Maybe sth about Wiremock? :)
when I say foo! you say bar! lmao
This educator is really engaging. Great job.
I like the way the tutorial incorporated humor üòÅThumbs up!

Thanks!
You are so great üòç, I was waiting for your video ‚ò∫Ô∏è thanks a lot
the jokes are really good they don&#39;t make me laugh from stomach but an entertaining chuckle is enough<br>to keep me going
I hope to get at least one belly laugh out of you. Just one.
the video is so well created <br>the editing is extremely good<br>and the explaination is good the fact that first few episodes are just exaplaination is good really good
Really excited for this one. Saw the first one more than 5 times and enjoyed it everytime. Love that it is once again being refreshed.
Welcome back!
what‚Äôs the difference between old and new one?
Great question Sanket! This one uses new REST API clients in addition to Postman (since Postman got harder to navigate as a newcomer). Instead of focussing on Python and JavaScript, we leaned into JavaScript and simplified the app creation process (as that wasn&#39;t what folks are here to learn). Spotify and Twilio updated a ton, and folks were having a hard time navigating around. Also I beatbox.
Instead of Lizzo it&#39;s Beyonc√©.
@7footmoustache thanks. You are doing wonderful job, love your teaching style
nice!!
Wow, what a great timing!! Will update here once done..
It&#39;s about time
Hoping this is a censored Lizzo reference.
i&#39;ve been waiting for this, thank you
Where is the course for writing an API ? It already exist on this channel ?
There are multiple ones on this channel, using Python, Django, .Net, Fastapi
@angmarliche9187 cool
@angmarliche9187 cool
Thank you, I was going to show the old video for my class to use APIs starting this week
Thank you for sharing with your class! I&#39;d love to know more about them!
@7footmoustache Showing my grade 11s in IB Higher Level Computer Science. We are getting through material quickly, so I wanted to show them something really useful. Thank you for all your videos, I originally learned about APIs from the first video and made something that drafted multiple post on google classroom. I&#39;m a self taught CS teacher and I would point to your videos as an exemplar online resource.
Are you going through my search history?
thank you
Awesome!!
I will come back in 10 years to see if the likes to this comment is at least 10% to the likes of the video. FOR NO REASON.
There&#39;s an API for that! Use the YouTube comments API!
