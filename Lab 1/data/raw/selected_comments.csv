"I learned about this concept in school but it was only briefly covered in a database class and I never understood the point of it until my last job. They were manually configuring hundreds of appliance-type devices through their web UI&#39;s which took hours of work. One small change request was many more hours of work again. I realized that these appliances had an API and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of IP&#39;s and sent API commands to each device in the list. I did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half. <br><br>As someone who is in IT but is not a developer, even I could see the enormous power and potential of the API. It opens the door to automation, which reduces human error dramatically. It also speeds up onboarding.
