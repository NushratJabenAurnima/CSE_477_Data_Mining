# Lab 2 — Text Mining Preprocessing (YouTube Comments & Captions)

## What this lab does
- Parse raw YouTube comments and .vtt captions
- Normalize text, tokenize, remove stopwords, lemmatize (WordNet)
- Export cleaned CSVs for reproducible EDA/modeling

## Run the notebook
Open: `Lab 2/notebooks/477_Lab2_Text_Mining_Preprocessing.ipynb`  
Run top-to-bottom. Outputs land in `Lab 2/data_processed/`:
- `cleaned_comments.csv`
- `cleaned_captions.csv`

## Folder map
- `data_processed/` – final CSVs (artifacts)
- `notebooks/` – preprocessing pipeline (.ipynb)
