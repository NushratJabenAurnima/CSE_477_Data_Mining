this course is an excellent introduction to apis for beginners this is an updated to apis for beginners this is an updated to apis for beginners this is an updated version of what is already one of the version of what is already one of the version of what is already one of the most popular API courses on the internet most popular API courses on the internet most popular API courses on the internet Craig Dennis is back as the instructor Craig Dennis is back as the instructor Craig Dennis is back as the instructor and in my opinion he is one of the best and in my opinion he is one of the best and in my opinion he is one of the best developer Educators out there hello I'm Craig and I'm a developer in this course Craig and I'm a developer in this course Craig and I'm a developer in this course we're going to be exploring a term that we're going to be exploring a term that we're going to be exploring a term that you've probably heard quite a bit that you've probably heard quite a bit that you've probably heard quite a bit that term is API or application programming interface in addition to being able to interface in addition to being able to interface in addition to being able to recite what it stands for when you recite what it stands for when you recite what it stands for when you complete this course you'll be able to complete this course you'll be able to complete this course you'll be able to discuss what an API does you'll understand why they exist and you'll be understand why they exist and you'll be understand why they exist and you'll be able to list the many benefits that they able to list the many benefits that they able to list the many benefits that they provide you'll even get some hands-on experience using a few popular web apis experience using a few popular web apis experience using a few popular web apis which will give you a taste of what all which will give you a taste of what all which will give you a taste of what all this excitement is about we'll be starting from the very beginning so there really isn't too much I'm going to there really isn't too much I'm going to there really isn't too much I'm going to be expecting you to know before starting be expecting you to know before starting be expecting you to know before starting this course I would like to request that this course I would like to request that this course I would like to request that you have a touch of experience with you have a touch of experience with you have a touch of experience with coding and a we bit of knowledge about coding and a we bit of knowledge about coding and a we bit of knowledge about the web if you've written any program at the web if you've written any program at the web if you've written any program at all even the typical first program you all even the typical first program you all even the typical first program you know the one where you write the words know the one where you write the words know the one where you write the words hello world if you've done that in any hello world if you've done that in any hello world if you've done that in any programming language you'll pretty much be ready for this course it will be ready for this course it will be ready for this course it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of how the web works with understanding of how the web works with understanding of how the web works with web servers and browsers but don't sweat web servers and browsers but don't sweat web servers and browsers but don't sweat it we'll touch on that too now if you it we'll touch on that too now if you it we'll touch on that too now if you haven't met these requirements please check the notes attached to this video check the notes attached to this video check the notes attached to this video for where to get started with some for where to get started with some for where to get started with some beginning web and programming Concepts that reminds me you should take some that reminds me you should take some that reminds me you should take some time to get used to your learning time to get used to your learning time to get used to your learning environment the notes that I just just environment the notes that I just just environment the notes that I just just discussed are attached to this video and discussed are attached to this video and discussed are attached to this

take breaks and you quite a bit to take breaks and you quite a bit to take breaks and encourage you to let what you just encourage you to let what you just encourage you to let what you just learned marinate all right let's get to learned marinate all right let's get to learned marinate all right let's get to it a p those three little letters it a p those three little letters it a p those three little letters generate quite the buzz don't they first generate quite the buzz don't they first generate quite the buzz don't they first I'd like to take some time up front here I'd like to take some time up front here I'd like to take some time up front here and clearly break down what is meant by and clearly break down what is meant by and clearly break down what is meant by application programming interface by understanding its purpose and a touch of understanding its purpose and a touch of understanding its purpose and a touch of its history I think you'll start to see its history I think you'll start to see its history I think you'll start to see its importance and be begin to understand why this term keeps popping up in your life after we get a good up in your life after we get a good up in your life after we get a good grasp on the what and the why of apis grasp on the what and the why of apis grasp on the what and the why of apis we'll go and learn how to explore two we'll go and learn how to explore two we'll go and learn how to explore two existing ones we'll get familiar with several handy tools that you can use to several handy tools that you can use to several handy tools that you can use to interact with web-based apis we'll use those tools to hit an external web API those tools to hit an external web API those tools to hit an external web API to send actual text messages and we'll to send actual text messages and we'll to send actual text messages and we'll get some interesting data back from a get some interesting data back from a get some interesting data back from a streaming music service API once we get streaming music service API once we get streaming music service API once we get some practice using the apis we'll use some practice using the apis we'll use some practice using the apis we'll use them in a web application that you'll them in a web application that you'll them in a web application that you'll actually publish the application that we're going to be building is going to we're going to be building is going to we're going to be building is going to receive User submitted photos via a text receive User submitted photos via a text receive User submitted photos via a text message and then we'll use an API to message and then we'll use an API to message and then we'll use an API to display a collection of all these photos display a collection of all these photos display a collection of all these photos and you get to come up with the prompt and you get to come up with the prompt and you get to come up with the prompt send me the latest photo on your phone send me the latest photo on your phone send me the latest photo on your phone dog pics please what's for dinner what dog pics please what's for dinner what dog pics please what's for dinner what whatever you want I can't wait to see whatever you want I can't wait to see whatever you want I can't wait to see what you build and what your family and what you build and what your family and what you build and what your family and friends submit to it we're going to be friends submit to it we're going to be friends submit to it we're going to be strictly using apis in this course we strictly using apis in this course we strictly using apis in this course we won't be writing our own while you most won't be writing our own while you most won't be writing our own while you most likely are going to end up learning some likely are going to end up learning some likely are going to end up learning some best practices in ABI design we won't be best practices in ABI design we won't be best practices in ABI design we won't be covering that specifically there there are many great courses available that show The Creation thought process and I've linked to some of my faves in the I've linked to some of my faves in the I've linked to some of my faves in the notes attached to this video in my notes attached to this video in my notes attached to this video in my opinion the best way to start learning opinion the best way to start learning opinion the best way to start learning about any acronym is to focus on each about any acronym is to focus on each about any acronym is to focus on each individual letter for a pi I I think we individual letter for a pi I I think we individual letter for a pi I I think we should start on that last character the should start on that last character the should start on that last character the ey interface let's talk a bit about the ey interface let's talk a bit about the ey interface let's talk a bit about the interfaces that you've seen already interfaces are all around us for already interfaces are all around us for already interfaces are all around us for instance this radio here it has a instance this radio here it has a instance this radio here it has a familiar interface the interface allows me to do things like change the volume me to do things like change the volume me to do things like change the volume change the station I can turn it off and change the station I can turn it off and change the station I can turn it off and on I literally have no idea how anything on I literally have no idea how anything on I literally have no idea how anything inside this thing works but still the inside this thing works but still the inside this thing works but still the interface allows me to control the way interface allows me to control the way interface allows me to control the way that it works through the options that it works through the options that it works through the options that are exposed and that's pretty great isn't it the magic that is happening is isn't it the magic that is happening is isn't it the magic that is happening is completely abstracted away from me I'm still in control of what has been still in control of what has been still in control of what has been determined that I a user can handle determined that I a user can handle determined that I a user can handle interfaces usually evolve over time like an alarm clock radio for example it has an alarm clock radio for example it has an alarm clock radio for example it has my familiar volume and station controls and it also adds some new features like and it also adds some new features like and it also adds some new features like changing the time and setting the alarm changing the time and setting the alarm changing the time and setting the alarm I still have no idea how this works I still have no idea how this works I still have no idea how this works implementation wise but the interface is something that I can understand usually and as technology evolves and new options come into existence they make their way into the new versions of make their way into the new versions of make their way into the new versions of the interface still abstracting away things for us but enabling us to be in things for us but enabling us to be in things for us but enabling us to be in control of the new features sometimes these physical interfaces get so recognizable they even make it into goys recognizable they even make it into goys recognizable they even make it into goys hey did you hear that there it is again hey did you hear that there it is again hey did you hear that there it is again gooey GUI graphical user interface this is my streaming music app on my phone is my streaming music app on my phone is my streaming music app on my phone there's my familiar play button in the there's my familiar play button in the there's my familiar play button in the user interface or UI and I know what the user interface or UI and I know what the user interface or UI and I know what the play button does when I press it but I play button does when I press it but I play button does when I press it but I have no idea how it does it and I'm okay have no idea how it does it and I'm okay have no idea how it does it and I'm okay with that level of abstraction what would I do in public transit without would I do in public transit without would I do in public transit without music like talk to people hi how's it going now the developer who wrote this going now the developer who wrote this streaming music of course understands how the play button Works she coded the how the play button Works she coded the how the play button Works she coded the button so that when it gets clicked the button so that when it gets clicked the button so that when it gets clicked the music starts playing here's the thing though our developer is also working with quite a few interfaces that are with quite a few interfaces that are with quite a few interfaces that are abstracting way some of the details for abstracting way some of the details for abstracting way some of the details for her for instance she wrote code that her for instance she wrote code that her for instance she wrote code that happens when the button is clicked she happens when the button is clicked she happens when the button is clicked she probably did that using an event handler probably did that using an event handler probably did that using an event handler on the button like on click what she on the button like on click what she on the button like on click what she didn't have to do however was write the didn't have to do however was write the didn't have to do however was write the code that makes the button interact and code that makes the button interact and code that makes the button interact and change with a press she didn't have to change with a press she didn't have to change with a press she didn't have to write the code that makes that familiar write the code that makes that familiar write the code that makes that familiar clicking noise it was already there for clicking noise it was already there for clicking noise it was already there for her buttons are in fact an interface her buttons are in fact an interface her buttons are in fact an interface they provide the developer the means of they provide the developer the means of they provide the developer the means of controlling its interactions while abstracting away how that actually works implementation wise this button is part of the API or application programming interface and it's available from the application framework that was used to create the app because most apps need create the app because most apps need create the app because most apps need buttons this interface has been created and provided to our developer or application programmer to use by implementing the button interface our developer was able to make her code run developer was able to make her code run developer was able to make her code run when the button was clicked it's worth when the button was clicked it's worth when the button was clicked it's worth noting that the code probably also uses noting that the code probably also uses noting that the code probably also uses a media player API that is provided with a media player API that is provided with a media player API that is provided with the operating system of the device like the operating system of the device like the operating system of the device like Android or iOS this media player API Android or iOS this media player API Android or iOS this media player API abstracts away needing to understand details of how to send audio data to details of how to send audio data to details of how to send audio data to Hardware the developer knows they just want to call the play Method on the want to call the play Method on the want to call the play Method on the media player API I suppose too the song isn't stored API I suppose too the song isn't stored API I suppose too the song isn't stored on the device it's being streamed over on the device it's being streamed over on the device it's being streamed over the network so a web-based API call has the network so a web-based API call has the network so a web-based API call has been made over the internet to get that been made over the internet to get that been made over the internet to get that data it's actually apis all the way down data it's actually apis all the way down data it's actually apis all the way down to the ones and zeros providing abstractions at many levels so let's take a look at what all of these take a look at what all of these take a look at what all of these interfaces have in common they all Define ways for us to interact or Define ways for us to interact or Define ways for us to interact or communicate with an object whether that object be physical or software and as a object be physical or software and as a object be physical or software and as a user of the interface we don't need to user of the interface we don't need to user of the interface we don't need to understand the implementation we don't need to know how it works we just need to know how it works we just need to know how it works we just need to know what we've been allowed to know what we've been allowed to know what we've been allowed to change or see interfaces abstract away the implementation now while the UI or the implementation now while the UI or the implementation now while the UI or user interface is made for the user of user interface is made for the user of user interface is made for the user of the application the API is made for the application the API is made for the application the API is made for the application programmer to use and extend in their applications with the I covered in their applications with the I covered in their applications with the I covered in our API let's take a deeper look at in our API let's take a deeper look at in our API let's take a deeper look at the rest of the API acronym an API is a contract of sorts it acronym an API is a contract of sorts it acronym an API is a contract of sorts it defines how it is expected to be used defines how it is expected to be used defines how it is expected to be used and it defines what you can expect to and it defines what you can expect to and it defines what you can expect to receive by using it think of it as a set receive by using it think of it as a set receive by using it think of it as a set of tools designed for software developers like yourself to use an API developers like yourself to use an API developers like yourself to use an API is created to help make your life easier is created to help make your life easier is created to help make your life easier by giving you access to data and by giving you access to data and by giving you access to data and by providing you with an abstraction of the providing you with an abstraction of the providing you with an abstraction of the implementation you know not needing to know how it's doing whatever it's doing know how it's doing whatever it's doing know how it's doing whatever it's doing they save you from needing to create they save you from needing to create they save you from needing to create everything yourself like when designed well they make nearly impossible things happen with just a few lines of code now happen with just a few lines of code now happen with just a few lines of code now you're probably starting to see why it's you're probably starting to see why it's you're probably starting to see why it's important to get familiar with them right I want to do a quick word of right I want to do a quick word of right I want to do a quick word of warning here about some naming issues that you'll probably run into these days that you'll probably run into these days that you'll probably run into these days the term API is almost always used as a the term API is almost always used as a the term API is almost always used as a way to explain web-based apis in fact way to explain web-based apis in fact way to explain web-based apis in fact it's probably safe to assume that when it's probably safe to assume that when it's probably safe to assume that when you hear API in the wild it's most you hear API in the wild it's most you hear API in the wild it's most likely that people are talking about a likely that people are talking about a likely that people are talking about a web- based API we'll explore those here web- based API we'll explore those here web- based API we'll explore those here in a few however if we focus on all in a few however if we focus on all in a few however if we focus on all types of apis instead of just the types of apis instead of just the types of apis instead of just the webbased subset we'll get a better look webbased subset we'll get a better look webbased subset we'll get a better look into why web-based apis are so popular into why web-based apis are so popular into why web-based apis are so popular so hang tight we're getting there apis so hang tight we're getting there apis so hang tight we're getting there apis are everywhere in your software Journey just about everywhere you look your your just about everywhere you look your your just about everywhere you look your your programming language whichever one that might be provides many apis let's take a might be provides many apis let's take a might be provides many apis let's take a look at one that is common in all of look at one that is common in all of look at one that is common in all of them they all provide some way of them they all provide some way of them they all provide some way of working with strings you know like a working with strings you know like a working with strings you know like a series of characters want to make your series of characters want to make your series of characters want to make your text all uppercase just call the API text all uppercase just call the API text all uppercase just call the API method and voila you could probably create the uppercase string all by yourself by doing some sort of lowlevel yourself by doing some sort of lowlevel yourself by doing some sort of lowlevel bit math on each character but you don't bit math on each character but you don't bit math on each character but you don't need to because your programming language has abstracted a way that for language has abstracted a way that for language has abstracted a way that for you and provided a handy string API it you and provided a handy string API it you and provided a handy string API it exists this because this is a common exists this because this is a common exists this because this is a common enough problem that developers run into because these programming language specifications are just interfaces different operating systems can supply their own implementation so that the code works properly in their environment I think an easy way of picturing this is I think an easy way of picturing this is I think an easy way of picturing this is to think about how different operating systems like Windows or Mac OS maintain systems like Windows or Mac OS maintain systems like Windows or Mac OS maintain their files they're totally different yet your programming language provides a single API for working with the file single API for working with the file single API for working with the file system you can write one script and it system you can write one script and it system you can write one script and it works both in math and windows it's the implementation that takes care of all of the details for you takes care of all of the details for you takes care of all of the details for you pretty cool right definitely something to be thankful for it makes their lives to be thankful for it makes their lives to be thankful for it makes their lives so much easier not having to worry about so much easier not having to worry about so much easier not having to worry about what operating system is being used and what operating system is being used and what operating system is being used and the importance of an API tool language the importance of an API tool language the importance of an API tool language cannot be understated there have been some fascinating legal cases where it's been questioned if the language API itself again not the implementation can be

and we really should thank giants folks and we really should thank giants folks and we really should thank those giants more often there are authors and maintainers of libraries that package up code to solve common that package up code to solve common that package up code to solve common problems so that you don't need to do it problems so that you don't need to do it problems so that you don't need to do it yourself for instance do you know know yourself for instance do you know know yourself for instance do you know know how to programmatically make a photo black and white me neither but I can black and white me neither but I can black and white me neither but I can download and import an image package into my application and suddenly I can I into my application and suddenly I can I

Frameworks provide an API that allow you to extend what has API that allow you to extend what has API that allow you to extend what has been provided to make it your own like been provided to make it

a new route to your web application it allows you to your web application it allows you to your web application it allows you to write out Dynamic data to a template write out Dynamic data to a template write out Dynamic data to a template that you specified and you do all of that you specified and you do all of that you specified and you do all of this with just a handful of lines of this with just a handful of lines of this with just a handful of lines of code you don't need to understand how code you don't need to understand how code you don't need to understand how it's doing things but you do need to it's doing things but you do need to it's doing things but you do need to know how to write an implementation to know how to write an implementation to know how to write an implementation to what the framework is expecting in this what the framework is expecting in this what the framework is expecting in this case you're using the API the contract case you're using the API the contract case you're using the API the contract to write a valid implementation that meets the requirements now all these apis that we just talked about they're apis that we just talked about they're apis that we just talked about they're local to our codebase they exist within local to our codebase they exist within local to our codebase they exist within our code we use them to avoid recreating our code we use them to avoid recreating our code we use them to avoid recreating the wheel that is to say they assist us the wheel that is to say they assist us the wheel that is to say they assist us in accomplishing tasks that we need to in accomplishing tasks that we need to in accomplishing tasks that we need to perform by abstracting away a ton of the perform by abstracting away a ton of the perform by abstracting away a ton of the work for us the stuff that we developers work for us the stuff that we developers work for us the stuff that we developers shouldn't be worrying about we should be shouldn't be worrying about we should be shouldn't be worrying about we should be focusing on the business problem at hand focusing on the business problem at hand focusing on the business problem at hand and that means a big part of your job is and that means a big part of your job is and that means a big part of your job is figuring out how to leverage these apis figuring out how to leverage these apis figuring out how to leverage these apis to your advantage now I think this is an to your advantage now I think this is an to your advantage now I think this is an excellent time for you to take a break I excellent time for you to take a break I excellent time for you to take a break I just gave you a lot to think about and just gave you a lot to think about and just gave

watching a video right now inside of a web browser when we return inside of a web browser when we return inside of a web browser when we return we'll explore the concept of remote apis we'll explore the concept of remote apis we'll explore the concept of remote apis ones that aren't executing locally in our codebase and why that is such a our codebase and why that is such a our codebase and why that is such a powerful concept [Music] it took me a while to find this remote it took me a while to find this remote it took me a while to find this remote control it was in the couch it's always control it was in the couch it's always control it was in the couch it's always on the couch anyways this remote has an on the couch anyways this remote has an on the couch anyways this remote has an interface on it right there's a power interface on it right there's a power interface on it right there's a power button and when I press the channel button and when I press the channel button and when I press the channel button it changes the channel when I button it changes the channel when I button it changes the channel when I press the volume button it sends the press the volume button it sends the press the volume button it sends the request to my radio and the volume request to my radio and the volume request to my radio and the volume changes as if I turn the volume up using changes as if I turn the volume up using changes as if I turn the volume up using the interface on the device itself and the interface on the device itself and the interface on the device itself and we know why that's important I want to we know why that's important I want to we know why that's important I want to remotely control my device I don't want remotely control my device I don't want remotely control my device I don't want to get up from my chair there are of to get up from my chair there are of to get up from my chair there are of course more less lazy reasons as to why course more less lazy reasons as to why course more less lazy reasons as to why we'd want to remote Ely control objects we'd want to remote Ely control objects we'd want to remote Ely control objects this cute little robot for instance has this cute little robot for instance has this cute little robot for instance has a remote API you can send commands to it a remote API you can send commands to it a remote API you can send commands to it and it responds and it even sends back and it responds and it even sends back and it responds and it even sends back sensor information these traffic signs can change based on an API call this can change based on an API call this can change based on an API call this drone here is remotely controlled by an drone here is remotely controlled by an drone here is remotely controlled by an app on my phone see and it's not just physical objects see and it's not just physical objects that benefit from remote apis often times we don't have space on our local times we don't have space on our local times we don't have space on our local machines for all the data that's available like for example have you ever available like for example have you ever available like for example have you ever used use one of those apps that helps used use one of those apps that helps used use one of those apps that helps you figure out what song is playing you figure out what song is playing you figure out what song is playing you send up a snippet of a song that you send up a snippet of a song that you send up a snippet of a song that you heard playing at a grocery store using heard playing at a grocery store using heard playing at a grocery store using your microphone and it sends back exactly what song it is it's usually exactly what song it is it's usually exactly what song it is it's usually Phil cins it turns out that both grocery Phil cins it turns out that both grocery Phil cins it turns out that both grocery stores and yours truly love Phil Colin stores and yours truly love Phil Colin stores and yours truly love Phil Colin you don't have room for all the songs in you don't have room for all the songs in you don't have room for all the songs in the world on your phone and with this the world on your phone and with this the world on your phone and with this remote API you don't need to have all of remote API you don't need to have all of remote API you don't need to have all of them it does all the searching and them it does all the searching and them it does all the searching and processing and it's surprisingly quick how can it possibly do that I don't know how can it possibly do that I don't know how can it possibly do that I don't know but I love the interface it's so fast but I love the interface it's so fast but I love the interface it's so fast ooh that's another benefit of remote apis computational power because an API removes the limitations of your local device you can gain access to seemingly device you can gain access to seemingly device you can gain access to seemingly infinite amounts of power a good example infinite amounts of power a good example infinite amounts of power a good example of this is the AR app of Google of this is the AR app of Google of this is the AR app of Google translate you can use the camera on your translate you can use the camera on your translate you can use the camera on your phone and in near real time it's able to phone and in near real time it's able to phone and in near real time it's able to translate directly to your screen like instantaneously it's using a ton of processing power to make that magic happen and that processing is happening elsewhere in L Nu it took quite a bit of elsewhere in L Nu it took quite a bit of elsewhere in L Nu it took quite a bit of experimentation and some evolution of ideas but over time we finally turned ideas but over time we finally turned ideas but over time we finally turned this remote API dream into a reality now this remote API dream into a reality now this remote API dream into a reality now I'm going to drop some history into the I'm going to drop some history into the I'm going to drop some history into the teacher notes but I just want you to teacher notes but I just want you to teacher notes but I just want you to know that the struggle to achieve this know that the struggle to achieve this know that the struggle to achieve this concept of remote apis was very real now concept of remote apis was very real now concept of remote apis was very real now most of the problem was that there most of the problem was that there most of the problem was that there wasn't a standard that everyone loved things were pretty clunky for a while as things were pretty clunky for a while as things were pretty clunky for a while as these ideas were sused out but then it these ideas were sused out but then it these ideas were sused out but then it happened a new architectural style appeared that was clear and allowed us appeared that was clear and allowed us appeared that was clear and allowed us developers to interact with specific resources over the web and it quite resources over the web and it quite resources over the web and it quite literally changed everything this style rapidly emerged as a winner and just rapidly emerged as a winner and just rapidly emerged as a winner and just about everyone began offering and consuming external apis over the internet and what I'm talking about here internet and what I'm talking about here internet and what I'm talking about here is rest or representational state transfer it was the approach that we transfer it was the approach that we transfer it was the approach that we needed and honestly it's the abstraction that we developers deserve like we talked about already the popularity of rest spread so rapidly that it nearly rest spread so rapidly that it nearly rest spread so rapidly that it nearly completely overtook the term API it's like how we use the word Xerox to mean like how we use the word Xerox to mean like how we use the word Xerox to mean photocopy even though Xerox is just a photocopy even though Xerox is just a photocopy even though Xerox is just a brand of photocopier Xerox does other stuff too I think that's how pervasive stuff too I think that's how pervasive stuff too I think that's how pervasive rest is rest is for sure not the end all rest is rest is for sure not the end all rest is rest is for sure not the end all be all of remote apis there are be all of remote apis there are be all of remote apis there are definitely some limitations which we'll discuss here in a bit technolog is ever discuss here in a bit technolog is ever discuss here in a bit technolog is ever evolving and of course there's movements that are still advancing the concept of that are still advancing the concept of that are still advancing the concept of the best remote apis some terms you the best remote apis some

rest sits on top of web because rest sits on top of web because rest sits on top of web Technologies like a really nice hat we Technologies like a really nice hat we Technologies like a really nice hat we should probably do a whirlwind refresher of how the web [Music] works it might have been a while since works it might have been a while since works it might have been a while since you thought about how the web works you thought about how the web works you thought about how the web works there are a smattering of terms that I'd there are a smattering of terms that I'd there are a smattering of terms that I'd like to reload into your working memory like to reload into your working memory like to reload into your working memory before we talk more about how rest uses before we talk more

you an API but it's similar in concept you an API but it's similar in concept you can think of it as defining the can think of it as defining the can think of it as defining the expectations of how to communicate like an example that I think really sticks an example that I think really sticks an example that I think really sticks with me is if you've ever been to a with me is if you've ever been to

just set up awkward anyways we you and I just set up awkward anyways we you and I just set up a real quick protocol I told you how to a real quick protocol I told you how to a real quick protocol I told you how to respond to my specific request and you respond to my specific request and you respond to my specific request and you would have been breaking our agreed upon would have been breaking our agreed upon would have been breaking our agreed upon protocol if you yelled anything else but protocol if you yelled anything else but protocol if you yelled anything else but P so the browser creates an HTTP request P so the browser creates an HTTP request P so the browser creates an HTTP request for you along with the URI it also for you along with the URI it also for you along with the URI it also specifies a particular HTTP verb in this specifies a particular HTTP verb in this specifies a particular HTTP verb in this case it is using the get verb which is case it is using the get verb which is case it is using the get verb which is used to clarify that this request will used to clarify that this request will used to clarify that this request will only receive data that is it won't be only receive data that is it won't be only receive data that is it won't be making any changes the server receives the request that was transferred from the client there's that second T the client there's that second T the client there's that second T the server then does the work that it needs server then does the work that it needs server then does the work that it needs to do finally it generates the resulting to do finally it generates the resulting to do finally it generates the resulting webpage and sends back a response to the webpage and sends back a response to the webpage and sends back a response to the client my browser in this case the most client my browser in this case the most client my browser in this case the most important part of the response is the important part of the response is the important part of the response is the body for a web page that contains the body for a web page that contains the body for a web page that contains the HTML hypertext markup language which gives us the remaining parts the HT of gives us the remaining parts the HT of gives us the remaining parts the HT of our acronym hypertext is text that can our acronym hypertext is text that can our acronym hypertext is text that can link to other text in HTML we perform link to other text in HTML we perform link to other text in HTML we perform that linking with anchor tags so with that linking with anchor tags so with that linking with anchor tags so with that response the browser renders the page when one of those links are clicked page when one of those links are clicked page when one of those links are clicked they kick off a brand new HTTP get they kick off a brand new HTTP get they kick off a brand new HTTP get request and the process repeats itself over and over in between those clicks over and over in between those clicks over and over in between those clicks though the protocol's done we've made the request we got the response HTTP as the request we got the response HTTP as the request we got the response HTTP as it was originally designed designed is a it was originally designed designed is a it was originally designed designed is a stateless protocol once that request receives a response it's all done if you receives a response it's all done if you receives a response it's all done if you want to keep some sort of State your want to keep some sort of State your want to keep some sort of State your client will have to manage that itself client will have to manage that itself client will have to manage that itself and send it up with each new request and send it up with each new request and send it up with each new request check out the notes for more on this check out the notes for more on this check out the notes for more on this there are more HTTP verbs also known as there are more HTTP verbs also known as there are more HTTP verbs also known as request methods besides get most common scenario you see is when you encounter a scenario you see is when you encounter a scenario you see is when you encounter a form that is used to take information form that is used to take information form that is used to take information from you typically you'll see the verb from you typically you'll see the verb from you typically you'll see the verb post used to explain that you are post used to explain that you are post used to explain that you are submitting or posting data to the Sur submitting or posting data to the Sur submitting or posting data to the Sur okay so our protocol that's used to okay so our protocol that's used to okay so our protocol that's used to transfer this hypertext is admittedly a little more complex than our rally chant little more complex than our rally chant little more complex than our rally chant was there's quite a bit of important was there's quite a bit of important was there's quite a bit of important information in there that is included in information in there that is included in information in there that is included in the request and the response you've probably seen query string parameters and URLs and you know the stuff after and URLs and you know the stuff after and URLs and you know the stuff after the question mark this is one way to the question mark this is one way to the question mark this is one way to pass information about the request another common way this information is passed around is through specific key and value pairs called headers both requests and responses have headers and they're used to help further communicate what is wanted as well as what has been what is wanted as well as what has been what is wanted as well as what has been sent back some of the popular request sent back some of the popular request sent back some of the popular request headers allow you to specify information about the content that you expect back about the content that you expect back about the content that you expect back like the language or the type of content like the language or the type of content like the language or the type of content you can also state that you want the you can also state that you want the you can also state that you want the page if it has changed since a certain page if it has changed since a certain page if it has changed since a certain time this technique allows for caching which is a powerful concept why get the which is a powerful concept why get the which is a powerful concept why get the whole page if you already have it in whole page if you already have it in whole page if you already have it in your local cach you can embed authentication information in each request using a header and this way request using a header and this way request using a header and this way you're essentially keeping your client logged in across requests this response also contains headers a super important one is the status code this lets you one is the status code this lets you one is the status code this lets you know what happened on the server side know what happened on the server side know what happened on the server side and can convey things like missing documents I'm sure you've seen the old documents I'm sure you've seen the old documents I'm sure you've seen the old 404 or maybe the page has moved but 404 or maybe the page has moved but 404 or maybe the page has moved but hopefully everything is a 200 okay it hopefully everything is a 200 okay it hopefully everything is a 200 okay it can also explain the content type how can also explain the content type how can also explain the content type how large the data returned is and many more large the data returned is and many more large the data returned is and many more things okay got it are you feeling good things okay got it are you feeling good things okay got it are you feeling good about that little Whirlwind tour remember feel free to make me repeat remember feel free to make me repeat remember feel free to make me repeat myself if that was too much I totally myself if that was too much I totally myself if that was too much I totally get it that was a lot of information get it that was a lot of information get it that was a lot of information it's important to have a basic understanding of these things because rest sits on top of them it uses the rest sits on top of them it uses the rest sits on top of them it uses the concepts that were introduced with the web to expose resources that can be web to expose resources that can be web to expose resources that can be accessed and manipulated let's take a look at how the restful approach takes look at how the restful approach takes look at how the restful approach takes advantage of the web and its tooling for advantage of the web and its tooling for advantage of the web and its tooling for your benefit profit rest stands for representational State transfer apis that meet the rest State transfer apis that meet the rest State transfer apis that meet the rest architectural style constraints are considered to be restful now a typical considered to be restful now a typical considered to be restful now a typical way to teach about restful apis is to way to teach about restful apis is to way to teach about restful apis is to cover the constraints that Define it all cover the constraints that Define it all cover the constraints that Define it all up front now I don't know about you but up front now I don't know about you but up front now I don't know about you but personally I find approaching learning that way pretty overwhelming especially from the beginning I mean we haven't from the beginning I mean we haven't from the beginning I mean we haven't even looked at an API yet on top of that even looked at an API yet on top of that even looked at an API yet on top of that most of the rest apis that you'll use most of the rest apis that you'll use most of the rest apis that you'll use will meet all of these constraints so will meet all of these constraints so will meet all of these constraints so here's the thing I promise that we'll go here's the thing I promise that we'll go here's the thing I promise that we'll go over all the constraints but let's do it over all the constraints but let's do it over all the constraints but let's do it on our own time like don't learn them on our own time like don't learn them on our own time like don't learn them all right this instant we could even all right this instant we could even all right this instant we could even make it a fun Journey like a restful make it a fun Journey like a restful make it a fun Journey like a restful constraint scavenger hunt complete with prizes void where prohibited here are the guiding architectural constraints required for an API to be considered required for an API to be considered required for an API to be considered restful we'll check them off when we restful we'll check them off when we restful we'll check them off when we discuss them and then we'll loop back discuss them and then we'll loop back discuss them and then we'll loop back once more at the end to review got to once more at the end to review got to once more at the end to review got to collect them all sound fun good let's collect them all sound fun good let's collect them all sound fun good let's get started talking about how rest API get started talking about how rest API get started talking about how rest API sits on top of web technology like a sits on top of web technology like a sits on top of web technology like a little hat much like the web the client little hat much like the web the client little hat much like the web the client makes a request to a server the client makes a request to a server the client makes a request to a server the client in this case is typically going to be in this case is typically going to be in this case is typically going to be your program and you'll probably be using some sort of library to create the using some sort of library to create the using some sort of library to create the request to the server the protocol used request to the server the protocol used request to the server the protocol used you guessed it it's HTTP and it's you guessed it it's HTTP and it's you guessed it it's HTTP and it's stateless the server won't remember anything about the particular client if you want to maintain State like your you want to maintain State like your you want to maintain State like your login details you must send it with each login details you must send it with each login details you must send it with each and every request you'll do this using and every request you'll do this using and every request you'll do this using headers and just like that we talked headers and just like that we talked headers and just like that we talked about two of our rest constraints client about two of our rest constraints client about two of our rest constraints client server architecture and stateless you got two knocked off already you're on a got two knocked off already you're on a got two knocked off already you're on a roll now we should probably talk about roll now we should probably talk about roll now we should probably talk about what that request was requesting right well it most certainly was requesting information about a resource now a resource is a little abstract and that's resource is a little abstract and that's resource is a little abstract and that's intentional it's the r in the URL or URI intentional it's the r in the URL or URI intentional it's the r in the URL or URI we use the term resource to reference an we use the term resource to reference an we use the term resource to reference an object also happens to be pretty abstract right and this is because we abstract right and this is because we abstract right and this is because we can use resources to describe just about can use resources to describe just about can use resources to describe just about anything that we build for instance let's imagine an ebook store website on let's imagine an ebook store website on let's imagine an ebook store website on the homepage there's a list or collection of new books each of these collection of new books each of these collection of new books each of these books is a resource we click in to take books is a resource we click in to take books is a resource we click in to take a closer look at that book resource and a closer look at that book resource and a closer look at that book resource and we see a link to the author which is we see a link to the author which is we see a link to the author which is also a resource we click into the author also a resource we click into the author also a resource we click into the author resource and we see a collection of all resource and we see a collection of all resource and we see a collection of all the other books they've written maybe we the other books they've written maybe we the other books they've written maybe we even see a group of fans again another even see a group of fans again another even see a group of fans again another collection and each of those fans are a collection and each of those fans are a collection and each of those fans are a resource clicking into a and resource we resource clicking into a and resource we resource clicking into a and resource we see a collection of their favorite authors in books everything is a resource let's change gears how about an resource let's change gears how about an resource let's change gears how about an image sharing application on your phone so we have user resources and those so we have user resources and those so we have user resources and those users post photos which are resources and those photos can be loved so there's and those photos can be loved so there's and those photos can be loved so there's a lover resource maybe there's an album a lover resource maybe there's an album a lover resource maybe there's an album that could be created there's an album that could be created there's an album that could be created there's an album resource that contains photos and albums have a collection of contributor resources turns out almost everything we ever want to build can be expressed in ever want to build can be expressed in ever want to build can be expressed in terms of resources and collections most of what we want our collections most of what we want our collections most of what we want our applications to be able to do to the applications to be able to do to the applications to be able to do to the resources can be expressed through the unfortunate sounding acronym crud and that stands for creating reading updating and deleting now as a user of updating and deleting now as a user of updating and deleting now as a user of the ebook site all we did was a bunch of the ebook site all we did was a bunch of the ebook site all we did was a bunch of reading no pun intended I actually did intend that one intended I actually did intend that one intended I actually did intend that one we were reading right just getting information to display it like we retrieved the author page we made a read retrieved the author page we made a read retrieved the author page we made a read request the web browser used a get request the web browser used a get request the web browser used a get request to the specific author page the request to the specific author page the request to the specific author page the restful API follows the same logic your restful API follows the same logic your restful API follows the same logic your program sends a get request to a URI program sends a get request to a URI program sends a get request to a URI then the server responds with data and then the server responds with data and then the server responds with data and of course all the HTTP headers you've of course all the HTTP headers you've of course all the HTTP headers you've come to know and love the body is come to know and love the body is come to know and love the body is typically represented these days as Json or JavaScript object notation Json provides a great way to structure and provides a great way to structure and provides a great way to structure and Nest your data every programming language that I can think of provides language that I can think of provides language that I can think of provides some means of turning a Json string into some means of turning a Json string into some means of turning a Json string into a native object the content type is a native object the content type is a native object the content type is typically something that you can specify in your request if Json isn't your thing in your request if Json isn't your thing in your request if Json isn't your thing if you recall there are other HTTP verbs if you recall there are other HTTP verbs if you recall there are other HTTP verbs available these verbs are used in rest available these verbs are used in rest available these verbs are used in rest apis to clearly State the intention of apis to clearly State the intention of apis to clearly State the intention of your request want to add an author post your request want to add an author post your request want to add an author post to the SL author's endpoint and send the to the SL author's endpoint and send the to the SL author's endpoint and send the data that you want to update in the body data that you want to update in the body data that you want to update in the body of your request now these fields will be of your request now these fields will be of your request now these fields will be defined for you somewhere want to remove defined for you somewhere want to remove defined for you somewhere want to remove an author send a delete to that specific an author send a delete to that specific an author send a delete to that specific author resource updates typically support the patch verb and you'll see support the patch verb and you'll see support the patch verb and you'll see we're able to represent our crud needs we're able to represent our crud needs we're able to represent our crud needs the create request update and delete using HTTP methods pretty cool right what this means is that you can interact what this means is that you can interact what this means is that you can interact with any application out there that's exposed their rest API you could grab exposed their rest API you could grab exposed their rest API you could grab data remotely automate tasks and even smos together different services this is called a mashup and here's the thing called a mashup and here's the thing called a mashup and here's the thing there are a ton of apis available just there are a ton of apis available just there are a ton of apis available just about anything that you could imagine and if they're truly restful they'll all and if they're truly restful they'll all and if they're truly restful they'll all feel pretty much the same you can build feel pretty much the same you can build feel pretty much the same you can build anything there are services that allow you to do incredible things with just a you to do incredible things with just a you to do incredible things with just a few simple API calls so now the question few simple API calls so now the question few simple API calls so now the question becomes what are you going to build so becomes what are you going to build so becomes what are you going to build so why don't you take a quick break and why don't you take a quick break and why don't you take a quick break and when you come back let's explore a when you come back let's explore a when you come back let's explore a restful API together we'll take a peek restful API together we'll take a peek restful API together we'll take a peek at how to use the music streaming at how to use the music streaming at how to use the music streaming service Spotify and their excellent restful API you have some Newfound understanding of how web-based apis work I walked you how web-based apis work I walked you how web-based apis work I walked you quickly through some imaginary rest apis and now I'm thinking it's time that we and now I'm thinking it's time that we and now I'm thinking it's time that we get a little more specific why don't we get a little more specific why don't we get a little more specific why don't we go exploring together some of these rest go exploring together some of these rest go exploring together some of these rest apis allow you to give it a try from the apis allow you to give it a try from the apis allow you to give it a try from the comfort of your very own web browser one comfort of your very own web browser one comfort of your very own web browser one of my personal favorites that allows for of my personal favorites that allows for of my personal favorites that allows for exploration is the streaming music service Spotify so here I am at service Spotify so here I am at service Spotify so here I am at spotify.com and now a quick word of spotify.com and now a quick word

with this uh so you could find out like uh uh this uh so you could find out like uh uh this uh so you could find out like uh uh different things like you could use an different things like you could use an different things like you could use an API to see uh uh the beats and the API to see uh uh the beats and the API to see uh uh the beats and the sections and the bars I think that sections and the bars I think that sections and the bars I think that there's a way to figure out if a song is there's a way to figure out if a song is there's a way to figure out if a song is dancable or not so that maybe I could dancable or not so that maybe I could dancable or not so that maybe I could import dancing we'll see and if I scroll import dancing we'll see and if I scroll import dancing we'll see and if I scroll back up to the top here you'll see that back up to the top here you'll see that back up to the top here you'll see that there's these different headings we've got this discover I think this is great got this discover I think this is great got this discover I think this is great if you're going to explore things we if you're going to explore things we if you're going to explore things we have this docs you'll see that there's have this docs you'll see that there's have this docs you'll see that there's all types of different uh actually apis all types of different uh actually apis all types of different uh actually apis and sdks software development kits which are apis which allow you to do different are apis which allow you to do different are apis which allow you to do different things you'll see that there's ones for things you'll see that there's ones for things you'll see that there's ones for iOS there's ones for Android what we're iOS there's ones for Android what we're iOS there's ones for Android what we're going to be focusing on is the one for going to be focusing on is the one for going to be focusing on is the one for the web API so if I click into that the web API so if I click into that the web API so if I click into that we'll get a nice overview of what this we'll get a nice overview of what this we'll get a nice overview of what this is I'm going to blow this up just a is I'm going to blow this up just a is I'm going to blow this up just a little bit uh so you'll see based on little bit uh so you'll see based on little bit uh so you'll see based on some simple rest representational State transfer principles that's our uh that's what we're doing that's what we're going what we're doing that's what we're going what we're doing that's what we're going through we're going through our um our through we're going through our um our through we're going through our um our scavenger hunt we're going through that there's a

uh come back and they are a Json object uh and we're going to be looking here at a and we're going to be looking here at a and we're going to be looking here at a tool uh in in the future called curl tool uh in in the future called curl tool uh in in the future called curl which you can use from your command line which you can use from your command line which you can use from your command line that's what this dollar sign here is that's what this dollar sign here is that's what this dollar sign here is talking about I I'll show you all this talking about I I'll show you all this talking about I I'll show you all this but basically it's saying that there's a but basically it's saying that there's a but basically it's saying that there's a lot of artists that come back you don't lot of artists that come back you don't lot of artists that come back you don't want all the artists and it will come want all the artists and it will come want all the artists and it will come back paginated uh and of course um you back paginated uh and of course um you back paginated uh and of course um you can use caching we'll take a look at can use caching we'll take a look at can use caching we'll take a look at that here you can you can and uh see if that here you can you can and uh see if that here you can you can and uh see if uh the thing has changed or not so we'll uh the thing has changed or not so we'll uh the thing has changed or not so we'll take a look at that and basically the take a look at that and basically the take a look at that and basically the response that comes back if everything's good it's going to say a 200 or these good it's going to say a 200 or these good it's going to say a 200 or these these 200 level uh accounts and then these 200 level uh accounts and then these 200 level uh accounts and then there's uh bad requests so if uh if you there's uh bad requests so if uh if you there's uh bad requests so if uh if you ask wrong or maybe maybe it wasn't found ask wrong or maybe maybe it wasn't found ask wrong or maybe maybe it wasn't found that's the 404 or unauthorized if we try that's the 404 or unauthorized if we try that's the 404 or unauthorized if we try to do one of those playlists uh we'd get to do one of those playlists uh we'd get to do one of those playlists uh we'd get it unauthorized and there's also if if it unauthorized and there's also if if it unauthorized and there's also if if you're a developer uh you never want to you're a developer uh you never want to you're a developer uh you never want to see this one it's the 500 it means you see this one it's the 500 it means you see this one it's the 500 it means you made an error um uh on the server side made an error um uh on the server side made an error um uh on the server side uh we won't be we' be doing any of those uh we won't be we' be doing any of those uh we won't be we' be doing any of those because we're just going to be hitting because we're just going to be hitting because we're just going to be hitting somebody else's code cool all right so somebody else's code cool all right so somebody else's code cool all right so um Spotify offers the ability to uh you um Spotify offers the ability to uh you um Spotify offers the ability to uh you can look at this and you can build your can look at this and you can build your can look at this and you can build your own curl request but one of the really own curl request but one of the really own curl request but one of the really nice things that I love about their API nice things that I love about their API nice things that I love about their API and uh you'll you'll find this happens and uh you'll you'll find this happens and uh you'll you'll find this happens often if we scroll back up here to the often if we scroll back up here to the often if we scroll back up here to the top sorry if I'm making you sick there top sorry if I'm making you sick there top sorry if I'm making you sick there and we're going to jump in here to uh and we're going to jump in here to uh and we're going to jump in here to uh what's known as the console over on the left are the things console over on the left are the things console over on the left are the things that we can do with their API and one of that we can do with their API and one of that we can do with their API and one of the things I want to do first first is I the things I want to do first first is I the things I want to do first first is I want to search you can see it's making a get to search you can see it's making a get to search you can see it's making a get to the search endpoint so I'm going to go the search endpoint so I'm going to go the search endpoint so I'm going to go into there and what's really nice is into there and what's really nice is into there and what's really nice is it's set it up so that we can kind of it's set it up so that we can kind of it's set it up so that we can kind of build the query that we're looking for build the query that we're looking for build the query that we're looking for so now we need to decide what we're so now we need to decide what we're so now we need to decide what we're going to do I think probably the first going to do I think probably the first going to do I think probably the first uh person that I would ever search for uh person that I would ever search for uh person that I would ever search for the first artist I would search for uh the first artist I would search for uh the first artist I would search for uh and you can see that here it's showing and you can see that here it's showing and you can see that here it's showing the different values of what that is I the different values of what that is I the different values of what that is I would I would probably search for Beyonce I mean right wouldn't you and I Beyonce I mean right wouldn't you and I Beyonce I mean right wouldn't you and I could choose is that a track or an could choose is that a track or an could choose is that a track or an artist so the type there is important artist so the type there is important artist so the type there is important and if I type artist uh you'll see that and if I type artist uh you'll see that and if I type artist uh you'll see that what's happening is you'll see the curl what's happening is you'll see the curl what's happening is you'll see the curl here is changing it's changing the it here is changing it's changing the it here is changing it's changing the it says the que is the Beyonce so that's says the que is the Beyonce so that's says the que is the Beyonce so that's one of the parameters that we're passing one of the parameters that we're passing one of the parameters that we're passing into the API and artist is here and you into the API and artist is here and you into the API and artist is here and you can see there's different uh things that can see there's different uh things that can see there's different uh things that we could do here what's really important we could do here what's really important we could do here what's really important is that it needs to have this ooth token is that it needs to have this ooth token is that it needs to have this ooth token now what's nice is we can build one of now what's nice is we can build one of now what's nice is we can build one of those even if we don't have a Spotify those even if we don't have a Spotify those even if we don't have a Spotify account so I'm going to do that I'm account so I'm going to do that I'm account so I'm going to do that I'm going to click this get token I am not going to click this get token I am not going to click this get token I am not currently logged in um and I actually currently logged in um and I actually currently logged in um and I actually don't have a Spotify account yet in this don't have a Spotify account yet in this don't have a Spotify account yet in this uh in this user I do have a Spotify uh in this user I do have a Spotify uh in this user I do have a Spotify account I love Spotify um and this is account I love Spotify um and this is account I love Spotify um and this is asking um basically what you would do is asking um basically what you would do is asking um basically what you would do is you would create a specific ooth token you would create a specific ooth token you would create a specific ooth token if you were ever to use this API outside if you were ever to use this API outside if you were ever to use this API outside of where we're doing this right now you of where we're doing this right now you of where we're doing this right now you would you would create one of these would you would create one of these would you would create one of these tokens so that you could log in uh later tokens so that you could log in uh later tokens so that you could log in uh later and you say what it is that you want so and you say what it is that you want so and you say what it is that you want so here's the playlist right we don't we're here's the playlist right we don't we're here's the playlist right we don't we're not going to do any of the playlist not going to do any of the playlist not going to do any of the playlist stuff we're just going to do a search stuff we're just going to do a search stuff we're just going to do a search maybe we'll look up some of Beyonce's uh maybe we'll look up some of Beyonce's uh maybe we'll look up some of Beyonce's uh Tunes but so I'm going to go and I'm Tunes but so I'm going to go and I'm Tunes but so I'm going to go and I'm going to click this request token so now going to click this request token so now going to click this request token so now it's asking me to either log in with my it's asking me to either log in with my it's asking me to either log in with my Spotify account which I can or I can Spotify account which I can or I can Spotify account which I can or I can create a new one and let's walk through create a new one and let's walk through create a new one and let's walk through that just in case you don't have a that just in case you don't have a that just in case you don't have a Spotify account already let's create a new one and this will be a my uh new one and this will be a my uh new one and this will be a my uh developer account here um uh so I'm developer account here um uh so I'm developer account here um uh so I'm going to put in my email so my email uh going to put in my email so my email uh going to put in my email so my email uh I don't know if you know about this but I don't know if you know about this but I don't know if you know about this but uh if you use Gmail you can uh uh you uh if you use Gmail you can uh uh you uh if you use Gmail you can uh uh you can do a little plus sign and it will can do a little plus sign and it will can do a little plus sign and it will still send to the left side of your still send to the left side of your still send to the left side of your Gmail so uh I'm going to do uh at Gmail so uh I'm going to do uh at Gmail so uh I'm going to do uh at Spotify sign up and uh that way any Spotify sign up and uh that way any Spotify sign up and uh that way any emails I get from here it will have that emails I get from here it will have that emails I get from here it will have that and it's a kind of a way to let you have and it's

looking this API uh and uh again when we looking this API uh and uh again when we looking at the artists um when we're looking at the artists um when we're looking at the artists um when we're looking at this get artist it's showing this curl this get artist it's showing this curl this get artist it's showing this curl command and we're going to take a look command and we're going to take a look command and we're going to take a look at that here in a bit but I just want to at that here in a bit but I just want to at that here in a bit but I just want to take a little bit of time I want you to take a little bit of time I want you to take a little bit of time I want you to go and take a look go back to this go and take a look go back to this go and take a look go back to this discover section and kind of get inspired by what's what's available right so so you can look at um there's right so so you can look at um there's right so so you can look at um there's these different things where you can you these different things where you can you these different things where you can you can I was right you can check and see if can I was right you can check and see if can I was right you can check and see if there's danceability of a song you can there's danceability of a song you can there's danceability of a song you can go and find a track and is dancable and go and find a

uh very high in the ability to come back uh very high in the ability to come back uh very high in the ability uh thing there but lots of powerful uh thing there but lots of powerful uh thing there but lots of powerful things and there's lots of cool examples things and there's lots of cool examples things and there's lots of cool examples that you can do that people have already that you can do that people have already that you can do that people have already gone and built and you can take a look gone and built and you can take a look gone and built and you can take a look at how they built it and how they use at how they built it and how they use at how they built it and how they use the API uh recommendations this is awesome really this is like super wide awesome really this is like super wide awesome really this is like super wide open to you and uh you can do all of open to you and uh you can do all of open to you and uh you can do all of this because of the apis that they this because of the apis that they this because of the apis that they provide pretty cool right you can get provide pretty cool right you can get provide pretty cool right you can get access to all of spotify's music library access to all of spotify's music library access to all of spotify's music library and you can build tools that extend and you can build tools that extend and you can build tools that extend their platform I highly recommend that you go and take a look at what other you go and take a look at what other you go and take a look at what other people have built using these apis it's people have built using these apis it's people have built using these apis it's super impressive did you notice how fast super impressive did you notice how fast super impressive did you notice how fast those results came back how could it do those results came back how could it do those results came back how could it do that search so quick oh wait a second that search so quick oh wait a second that search so quick oh wait a second does it even need to those results don't does it even need to those results don't does it even need to those results don't change all the time it's not like change all the time it's not like change all the time it's not like Beyonce is dropping a new song every Beyonce is dropping a new song every Beyonce is dropping a new song every minute though I wish she would those minute though I wish she would those minute though I wish she would those results are definitely cashable ding ding ding cacheability is also available on the client and we'll get to that here on the client and we'll get to that here on the client and we'll get to that here in a bit but this is a great example of in a bit but this is a great example of in a bit but this is a great example of a layered system I'm almost positive that Spotify has set up things so that Spotify has set up things so that Spotify has set up things so that it Returns the same Json from its own it Returns the same Json from its own it Returns the same Json from its own server side caching mechanism it's not rendered that on every single request as rendered that on every single request as rendered that on every single request as a user of the API I don't know how it's a user of the API I don't know how it's a user of the API I don't know how it's doing that and frankly I don't care I doing that and frankly I don't care I doing that and frankly I don't care I want it to be available and fast when I want it to be available and fast when I want it to be available and fast when I hit that specific URL beyon definitely appreciates how fast the results will return she might even take that API Dev return she might even take that API Dev return she might even take that API Dev to Red Lobster let's go ahead and take a to Red Lobster let's go ahead and take a to Red Lobster let's go ahead and take a quick break during this break I'd love quick break during this break I'd love quick break during this break I'd love for you to move around and think about for you to move around and think about for you to move around and think about what you might be able to build with what you might be able to build with what you might be able to build with that Spotify API for inance while I was using this API I had this while I was using this API I had this while I was using this API I had this idea pop up when I'm at a music festival idea pop up when I'm at a music festival idea pop up when I'm at a music festival I often have a hard time deciding which I often have a hard time deciding which I often have a hard time deciding which band I should go see there's so many now band I should go see there's so many now band I should go see there's so many now I would love to have an app suggest to I would love to have an app suggest to I would love to have an app suggest to me which of the bands that are currently me which of the bands that are currently me which of the bands that are currently playing I would most likely enjoy you playing I would most likely enjoy you playing I would most likely enjoy you know based on my listening habits I'm know based on my listening habits I'm know based on my listening habits I'm pretty sure that you could build that pretty sure that you could build that pretty sure that you could build that just with the Spotify API and using a just with the Spotify API and using a just with the Spotify API and using a list of events of the bands that are list of events of the bands that are list of events of the bands that are performing and if you do end up building performing and if you do end up building performing and if you do end up building that share it with me cuz I need it what that share it with me cuz I need it what that share it with me cuz I need it what other interests do you have that provide other interests do you have that provide other interests do you have that provide an API that you can use check the notes an API that you can use check the notes an API that you can use check the notes for more ideas now after you come back for more ideas now after you come back for more ideas now after you come back from your break let's dive a little from your break let's dive a little from your break let's dive a little deeper and make use of an API using our deeper and make use of an API using our deeper and make use of an API using our own tools see you soon no really take a quick break soon no really take a quick break soon no really take a quick break seriously it'll do you good no binging well I realize that exploring an API on well I realize that exploring an API on a website is informative it might not a website is informative it might not a website is informative it might not feel like you're actually using that API feel like you're actually using that API feel like you're actually using that API I think the next logical step in I think the next logical step in I think the next logical step in exploring is actually making that request yourself from your computer not from a website now as I pointed out in from a website now as I pointed out in from a website now as I pointed out in the Spotify docs there were examples that were using a command called curl that were using a command called curl that were using a command called curl curl is an open source tool that is used curl is an open source tool that is used curl is an open source tool that is used to send data back and forth and it runs to send data back and forth and it runs to send data back and forth and it runs locally on your computer and it's awesome for poking around at apis what awesome for poking around at apis what awesome for poking around at apis what do you say we explore it a bit okay so do you say we explore it a bit okay so do you say we explore it a bit okay so we are back here on our Spotify page and we are back here on our Spotify page and we are back here on our Spotify page and we say that there is a command here that we say that there is a command here that we say that there is a command here that says curl curl is a command that we can run curl curl is a command that we can run curl curl is a command that we can run from our terminal now if both of those from our terminal now if both of those from our terminal now if both of those terms are new to you command and terms are new to you command and terms are new to you command and terminal this is a great time to head terminal this is a great time to head terminal this is a great time to head over to the notes and learn about what over to the notes and learn about what over to the notes and learn about what the terminal is so my operating system the terminal is so my operating system the terminal is so my operating system is a Mac and it has an application on it is a Mac and it has an application on it is a Mac and it has an application on it uh called terminal so I'm going to open uh called terminal so I'm going to open uh called terminal so I'm going to open that up terminal and in fact I'm going that up terminal and in fact I'm going that up terminal and in fact I'm going to make this a little bit bigger let's to make this a little bit bigger let's to make this a little bit bigger let's go ahead let's let's take let it take up go ahead let's let's take let it take up go ahead let's let's take let it take up the whole screen we're going to be in the whole screen we're going to be in the whole screen we're going to be in here for a little bit so I'm going to here for a little bit so I'm going to here for a little bit so I'm going to type clear and clear my window all right type clear and clear my window all right type clear and clear my window all right so um uh this terminal allows me to so um uh this terminal allows me to so um uh this terminal allows me to perform actions on my computer like I perform actions on my computer like I perform actions on my computer like I can make a d text to speech I can do say can make a d text to speech I can do say can make a d text to speech I can do say and I can say hi Mom hi Mom and it says and I can say hi Mom hi Mom and it says and I can say hi Mom hi Mom and it says Hi mom um uh and the Windows operating Hi mom um uh and the Windows operating Hi mom um uh and the Windows operating system has a terminal as well and while system has a terminal as well and while system has a terminal as well and while it's a little bit different they're actually pretty quite similar uh but check the notes for more on this so what check the notes for more on this so what check the notes for more on this so what happens is I write the command and then happens is I write the command and then happens is I write the command and then I pass in values for the parameter in I pass in values for the parameter in I pass in values for the parameter in this case it's high mom now note that I this case it's high mom now note that I this case it's high mom now note that I used quotes there because I want to pass used quotes there because I want to pass used quotes there because I want to pass one value even though there is a space one value even though there is a space one value even though there is a space if there was a space is kind of how you if there was a space is kind of how you if there was a space is kind of how you separate things but with the quotes it's separate things but with the quotes it's separate things but with the quotes it's saying this is one value that I'm saying this is one value that I'm saying this is one value that I'm passing in we developers spend a lot of passing in we developers spend a lot of passing in we developers spend a lot of time in our terminals so if this is new time in our terminals so if this is new time in our terminals so if this is new to you I want you to remember that it to you I want you to remember that it to you I want you to remember that it was new to everyone at one time so was new to everyone at one time so was new to everyone at one time so please take your time and don't let this please take your time and don't let this please take your time and don't let this get you too frustrated you've got this get you too frustrated you've got this get you too frustrated you've got this so I already have curl installed uh I'm so I already have curl installed uh I'm so I already have curl installed uh I'm going to just go Ahad ahead and make going to just go Ahad ahead and make going to just go Ahad ahead and make sure that I Do by typing the word curl sure that I Do by typing the word curl sure that I Do by typing the word curl and if I see this I can see that I could and if I see this I can see that I could and if I see this I can see that I could type curl and then the command-- help type curl and then the command-- help type curl and then the command-- help now if I didn't have this installed if now if I didn't have this installed if now if I didn't have this installed if this came back with like I don't know this came back with like I don't know this came back with like I don't know what you're talking about when you type what you're talking about when you type what you're talking about when you type curl the word curl uh that's okay so um curl the word curl uh that's okay so um curl the word curl uh that's okay so um uh we're going to head over to the notes uh we're going to head over to the notes uh we're going to head over to the notes uh and you'll get sorted there but the uh and you'll get sorted there but the uh and you'll get sorted there but the starting point where you I want you to starting point where you I want you to starting point where you I want you to go is curl.,"['spotify', 'com',

I'll show you how I did it okay are you ready you got this did it okay are you ready you got this did it okay are you ready you got this pause me cool so how'd you do so here's me cool so how'd you do so here's probably one way that you could have probably one way that you could have probably one way that you could have done it is just copied that right copied done it is just copied that right copied done it is just copied that right copied this whole thing and paste did it but this whole thing and paste did it but this whole thing and paste did it but what I want to show you is that we have what I want to show you is that we have what I want to show you is that we have access to we know what these these these access to we know what these these these access to we know what these

um so I could have just copied still um so I could have just just ran that query and copied the curl just ran that query and copied the curl just ran that query and copied the curl and pasted it here and if you did that and pasted it here and if you did that and pasted it here and if you did that you did it right I just want to show you did it right I just want to show you did it right I just want to show you a little bit more of what else how we a little bit more of what else how we a little bit more of what else how we could explore so I'm going to press the could explore so I'm going to

don't need to do this this program you don't need to do this this is just something if you're doing it is just something if you're doing it is just something if you're doing it from the command line it's something that we do that we could kind of hack that we do that we could kind of hack that we do that we could kind of hack around with a little bit and you'll see around with a little bit and you'll see around with a little bit and you'll see I can get all the the lists of her I can get all the the lists of her I can get all the the lists of her albums and that's pretty cool right that's powerful and if you are going to that's powerful and if you are going to that's powerful and if you are going to just start poking around and moving around with the URLs one thing I wanted around with the URLs one thing I wanted around with the URLs one thing I wanted to make sure that you're cautious of is to make sure that you're cautious of is to make sure that you're cautious of is if we come back and we take a look at uh if we come back and we take a look at uh if we come back and we take a look at uh the the console page here they do a nice the the console page here they do a nice the

like if you were trying to to mess like if you were trying to to mess like if you were trying to to mess around and and work with the search around and and work with the search around and and work with the search you'd want to make sure that whatever you'd want to make sure that whatever you'd want to make sure that whatever you did you passed that uh with those you did you passed that uh with those you did you passed that uh with those those plus signs there so I'm going to those plus signs there so I'm going to those plus signs there so I'm going to run that curl command we'll see who

like we saw with find that often just like we saw with find that often just like we saw with Spotify apis will use Curl in their Spotify apis will use Curl in their Spotify apis will use Curl in their docks to show you how they work Spotify docks to show you how they work Spotify docks to show you how they work Spotify is just one API and there are so many is just one API and there are so many is just one API and there are so many companies and services out there in fact companies and services out there in fact companies and services out there in fact some apis are the product like that's some apis are the product like that's some apis are the product like that's what the company's selling to us developers so now that we've been building up those muscles why don't we building up those muscles why don't we building up those muscles why don't we take a swing at another API let's use a different API this time API let's use a different API this time API let's use a different API this time let's use twilio twio is a company that let's use twilio twio is a company that let's use twilio twio is a company that loves apis in fact that's what the loves apis in fact that's what the loves apis in fact that's what the company started as more than a decade company started as more than a decade company started as more than a decade ago just a set of apis it started as ago just a set of apis it started as ago just a set of apis it started as abstracting away communication channels and by that I mean any way you'd ever and by that I mean any way you'd ever and by that I mean any way you'd ever possibly want to communicate with your users want to send a text message users want to send a text message users want to send a text message there's an API call for that want to there's an API call for that want to there's an API call for that want to make a phone call there's an API send an make a phone call there's an API send an make a phone call there's an API send an email a whatsa message literally whichever way you want to communicate there's an API for all of them there's an API for all of them there's an API for all of them developers embed these apis into their apps and I'm pretty sure that you've apps and I'm pretty sure that you've apps and I'm pretty sure that you've probably used it without even knowing you were now nowadays there's a whole you were now nowadays there's a whole you were now nowadays there's a whole Suite of products that quo offers that Suite of products that quo offers that Suite of products that quo offers that they saw their customers needing but under the covers it's still these apis under the covers it's still these apis under the covers it's still these apis that are powering everything I need to be a little up everything I need

even applied for a I love it so much I even applied for a I love it so much I even applied for a job with them and I got it but even if job with them and I got it but even if job with them and I got it but even if they didn't hire me I know that I'd they didn't hire me I know that I'd they didn't hire me I know that I'd still show off how powerful their apis still show off how powerful their apis still show off how powerful their apis are I mean with a single command you can are I mean with a single command you can are I mean with a single command you can send a text message I remember when I send a text message I remember when I send a text message I remember when I first did that I was like w like that first did that I was like w like that first did that I was like w like that level of abstraction is amazing I mean level of abstraction is amazing I mean level of abstraction is amazing I mean if you've never thought about it before if you've never thought about it before if you've

on my phone and I can know I have an app on my phone and I can use it to communicate with literally anyone else but how does that work like anyone else but how does that work like anyone else but how does that work like there's all those different cell carriers and standards and phone numbers I mean I I have no idea and with twilio I mean I I have no idea and with twilio I mean I I have no idea and with twilio I don't need to know that's the beauty I don't need to know that's the beauty I don't need to know that's the beauty of this API it just works here let me of this API it just works here let me of this API it just works here let me show you all right so here we are at show you all right so here we are at show you all right so here we are at twilio.com and again a word of warning twilio.com and again a word of warning twilio.com and again a word of warning this is going to look completely different from my right now to your different from my right now to your different from my right now to your right now uh so please make sure that right now uh so please make sure that right now uh so please make sure that you check the notes for anything that you check the notes for anything that you check the notes for anything that might have changed and it's specifically about this flow that we're about ready about this flow that we're about ready about this flow that we're about ready to do is we're going to sign up for a to do is we're going to sign up for a to do is we're going to sign up for a trial account so I'm going to click this trial account so I'm going to click this trial account so I'm going to click this sign up button here and this is going to sign up button here and this is going to sign up button here and this is going to look completely different I know because our team is constantly making this better uh but the one thing that I want better uh but the one thing that I want better uh but the one thing that I want to make sure that you know right now is to make sure that you know right now is to make sure that you know right now is that you see that there is no credit that you see that there is no credit that you see that there is no credit card required and it is a free twilio card required and it is a free twilio card required and it is a free twilio account so I'm going to put my uh account so I'm going to put my uh account so I'm going to put my uh information in here and I'm going to use information in here and I'm going to use information in here and I'm going to use the same trick that I used uh uh before the same trick that I used uh uh before the same trick that I used uh uh before uh where I do plus and I'm going to say uh where I do plus and I'm going to say uh where I do plus and I'm going to say API course uh V2 gmail.com so I uh the API course uh V2 gmail.com so I uh the API course uh V2 gmail.com so I uh the plus side there again a little Gmail plus side there again a little Gmail plus side there again a little Gmail trick um uh we're going to go ahead I'm trick um uh we're going to go ahead I'm trick um uh we're going to go ahead I'm going to put in my password again uh 1 2 going to put in my password again uh 1 2 going to put in my password again uh 1 2 3 4 5 six my luggage how many times can 3 4 5 six my luggage how many times can 3 4 5 six my luggage how many times can I do that joke and then uh would I do that joke and then uh would I do that joke and then uh would I do this except uh must be 16 or more this except uh must be 16 or more this except uh must be 16 or more characters okay there's some password requirements over there I think that's 16 all right uh here we I think that's 16 all right uh here we go starting my free trial I'm ready let's do this I'm definitely going to save that this I'm definitely going to save that this I'm definitely going to save that long password because I need that for long password because I need that for long password because I need that for later all right so I have now uh should later all right so I have now uh should later all right so I have now uh should have been sent an email so let me make have been sent an email so let me make have been sent an email so let me make sure that I got that email and I did I am going to click uh email and I did I am going to click uh email and I did I am going to click uh the link to verify it and here we go I'm the link to verify it and here we go I'm the link to verify it and here we go I'm going to verify my phone number uh to going to verify my phone number uh to going to verify my phone number uh to verify I'm human because all humans have verify I'm human because all humans have verify I'm human because all humans have phones so we're going to do 432 527 phones so we're going to do 432 527 phones so we're going to do 432 527 4274 please don't call too late uh I'm 4274 please don't call too late uh I'm 4274 please don't call too late uh I'm going to try that I'm going to click going to try that I'm going to click going to try that I'm going to click verify all right so I got my verify all right so I got my verify all right so I got my verification code hey that came very quickly what's wonderful my verification code uh is 017 869 uh hopefully your code's different than that wouldn't that be funny if they than that wouldn't that be funny if they than that wouldn't that be funny if they were all the same uh all right so here were all the same uh all right so here were all the same uh all right so here we go so which product are we here to we go so which product are we here to we go so which product are we here to use we're going to use SMS we're going use we're going to use SMS we're going use we're going to use SMS we're going to use the SMS messaging product and to use the SMS messaging product and to use the SMS messaging product and what do we plan to build uh let's see uh what do we plan to build uh let's see uh what do we plan to build uh let's see uh of course these questions are going to of course these questions are going to of course these questions are going to be different uh what are we going to do be different uh what are we going to do be different uh what are we going to do we're going to build um build something else we're going to um build something else we're going to um build something else we're going to build something else uh we how do we build something else uh we how do we build something else uh we how do we want to build with with twilio with code want to build with with twilio with code want to build with with twilio with code right so we're g end up writing code if right so we're g end up writing code if right so we're g end up writing code if we want to with minimal code on top of we want to with minimal code on top of we want to with minimal code on top of code samples or no code at all so uh code samples or no code at all so uh code samples or no code at all so uh definitely don't need code to build over definitely don't need code to build over definitely don't need code to build over here but I'm going to say with code here but I'm going to say with code here

you are on a trial know this this stuff you are on a trial know this this stuff you are on a trial account so there are some limitations you can only send messages and make you can only send messages and make you can only send messages and make calls to verified phone numbers so when calls to verified phone numbers so when calls to verified phone numbers so when we set things up we verified like I'm we set things up we verified like I'm we set things up we verified like I'm able to send a text to myself because I able to send a text to myself because I able to send a text to myself because I verified my phone number I and it will verified my phone number I and it will verified my phone number I and it will say sent from my twio account beforehand say sent from my twio account beforehand

the right you'll see that over here on the right um there are uh things that you can do um there are uh things that you can do um there are uh things that you can do that that that show you what you can do that that that show you what you can do that that that show you what you can do so with this message we can do all these so with this message we can do all these so with this message we can do all these different things U we'll start with create a message we'll create a message we'll create a message we'll create a message first so we're going to go uh into this first so we're going to go uh into this first so we're going to go uh into this create a message and uh there's these create a message and uh there's these create a message and uh there's these different languages here so we have JS different languages here so we have JS different languages here so we have JS uh and you can see the style that it uh and you can see the style that it uh and you can see the style that it looks like we'll take a look at at looks like we'll take a look at at looks like we'll take a look at at something like this here real shortly this is a helper library that wraps this is a helper library that wraps this is a helper library that wraps around the API so you don't need to do around the API so you don't need to do around the API so you don't need to do the sorts of things that uh uh we're the sorts of things that uh uh we're the sorts of things that uh uh we're we're about ready to have to do you can we're about ready to have to do you can we're about ready to have to do you can you could do things a little bit more you could do things a little bit more you could do things a little bit more cleanly but what we're going to look at cleanly but what we're going to look at cleanly but what we're going to look at is curl right so here's our friend Curl is curl right so here's our friend Curl is curl right so here's our friend Curl we're going to jump over here to curl we're going to jump over here to curl we're going to jump over here to curl and uh the docs have this really nice and uh the docs have this really nice and uh the docs have this really nice thing where I'm able to actually copy thing where I'm able to actually copy thing where I'm able to actually copy this so I'm going to click uh to copy this so I'm going to click uh to copy this so I'm going to click uh to copy this and I'm going to pop over to my this and I'm going to pop over to my this and I'm going to pop over to my terminal now again I'm running on a Mac terminal now again I'm running on a Mac terminal now again I'm running on a Mac so there's a couple of things here that so there's a couple of things here that so there's a couple of things here that this is assuming that is going to be this is assuming that is going to be this is assuming that is going to be okay because I am running uh on a Mac okay because I am running uh on a Mac okay because I am running uh on a Mac it's going to assume uh that these it's going to assume uh that these it's going to assume uh that these slashes see these slashes at the end slashes see these slashes at the end slashes see these slashes at the end here um these uh in on a Mac terminal here um these uh in on a Mac terminal here um these uh in on a Mac terminal these show that we're in the new we're these show that we're in the new we're these show that we're in the new we're making a new line available here and making a new line available here and making a new line available here and also you'll see that there's these account SIDS and these off tokens this account SIDS and these off tokens this account SIDS and these off tokens this dollar sign twilio off token dollar sign twilio off token dollar sign twilio off token dollar sign twio account Sid um in my terminal on my twio account Sid um in my terminal on my twio account Sid um in my terminal on my Mac that is what's known as an Mac that is what's known as an Mac that is what's known as an environment variable and they've been set now um I don't have those set now um I don't have those set now um I don't have those set currently because I just uh built this currently because I just uh built this currently because I just uh built this account so what I'm going to do is um account so what I'm going to do is um account so what I'm going to do is um kind of bad practice actually I'm going kind of bad practice actually I'm going kind of bad practice actually I'm going to actually put my real uh information to actually put my real uh information to actually put my real uh information here for us to use so so back back here for us to use so so back back here for us to use so so back back here on our uh console on our tro console on our uh console on our tro console on our uh console on our tro console you'll see that I have this thing here you'll see that I have this thing here you'll see that I have this thing here called this account Sid or string identifier so this is my ID my unique ID identifier so this is my ID my unique ID identifier so this is my ID my unique ID for the account that I just created so for the account that I just created so for the account that I just created so I'm going to go I'm going to click this I'm going to go I'm going to click this I'm going to go I'm going to click this copy button so I copied that I'm going copy button so I copied that I'm going copy button so I copied that I'm going to come back here and I'm going to move to come back here and I'm going to move to come back here and I'm going to move my mouse and I'm going to remove right my mouse and I'm going to remove right my mouse and I'm going to remove right here where it says account Sid so that's here where it says account Sid so that's here where it says account Sid so that's string identifier I'm going to paste this so that is the way that twilio is this so that is the way that twilio is this so that is the way that twilio is uh identifying who I am I'm going to go uh identifying who I am I'm going to go uh identifying who I am I'm going to go backwards through the rest of these and backwards through the rest of these and backwards through the rest of these and so uh if you're watching here on Windows so uh if you're watching here on Windows so uh if you're watching here on Windows let's just go ahead let's get rid of let's just go ahead let's get rid of let's just go ahead let's get rid of these uh these new lines here um so I'm these uh these new lines here um so I'm these uh these new lines here um so I'm going to just put them all on one line going to just put them all on one line going to just put them all on one line uh we can handle that we'll do that so uh we can handle that we'll do that so uh we can handle that we'll do that so I'm going to uh get rid of that line I'm going to uh get rid of that line I'm going to uh get rid of that line and uh that way it will work uh and uh that way it will work uh and uh that way it will work uh completely on uh both both Windows and completely on uh both both Windows and completely on uh both both Windows and Mac uh for what we're trying to do so I Mac uh for what we're trying to do so I Mac uh for what we're trying to do so I still have my uh account Sid here so I'm still have my uh account Sid here so I'm still have my uh account Sid here so I'm going to keep on backing up here uh and I'm going to get rid of that here uh and I'm going to get rid of that line there we go and you'll see one more line there we go and you'll see one more line there we go and you'll see one more time here there's the too account Sid time here there's the too account Sid time here there's the too account Sid that string identifier for my account was still present so I'm G to paste that was still present so I'm G to paste that was still present so I'm G to paste that there so now the API call that I'm doing there so now the API call that I'm doing there so now the API call that I'm doing is to that specific account it's doing is to that specific account it's doing is to that specific account it's doing to this messages and you'll note that to this messages and you'll note that to this messages and you'll note that it's doing now it's doing a post so it's doing now it's doing a post so it's doing now it's doing a post so because we're creating something new right so we're using post to create a right so we're using post to create a right so we're using post to create a message and you'll see here that it says message and you'll see here that it says message and you'll see here that it says from equals and uh the number actually from equals and uh the number actually from equals and uh the number actually there for the from we want that to be there for the from we want that to be there for the from we want that to be the twilio number that we just got right the twilio number that we just got right the twilio number that we just got right so that new one that we just got we're so that new one that we just got we're so that new one that we just got we're going to say that is sent from let me go back I'm gonna copy my tlio phone number back I'm gonna copy my tlio phone number back I'm gonna copy my tlio phone number right so I've got my my 561 number there right so I've got my my 561 number there right so I've got my my 561 number there and I'm going to paste that here so and I'm going to paste that here so and I'm going to paste that here so uh from and the this plus 561 that's a uh from and the this plus 561 that's a uh from and the this plus 561 that's a US number so it's got that the it's US number so it's got that the it's US number so it's got that the it's called a 10 digigit long code 10 DLC so called a 10 digigit long code 10 DLC so called a 10 digigit long code 10 DLC so it's 561 816 5433 is the number that I it's 561 816 5433 is the number that I it's 561 816 5433 is the number that I just bought and uh we're going to say by just bought and uh we're going to say by just bought and uh we're going to say by default it said hi there um the body of default it said hi there um the body of default it said hi there um the body of the message right so instead of that the message right so instead of that the message right so instead of that what we're going to do and note that what we're going to do and note that what we're going to do and note that this is all in quot quotes we're going this is all in quot quotes we're going this is all in quot quotes we're going to say aoy world I don't know if you to say aoy world I don't know if you to say aoy world I don't know if you know this or not but the the first word know this or not but the the first word know this or not but the the first word the way that we used to answer the phone the way that we used to answer the phone the way that we used to answer the phone um was uh we'd say the phone would ring um was uh we'd say the phone would ring um was uh we'd say the phone would ring and you'd be like aoy and the other side and you'd be like aoy and the other side and you'd be like aoy and the other side would go aoy Hoy so we like to do that would go aoy Hoy so we like to do that would go aoy Hoy so we like to do that here a lot at chulia we say aoy world here a lot at chulia we say aoy world here a lot at chulia we say aoy world it's kind of like the Holo world of this it's kind of like the Holo world of this it's kind of like the Holo world of this so the body of the message the text that so the body of the message the text that so the body of the message the text that we're going to get uh is going to say we're going to get uh is going to say we're going to get uh is going to say aoy world and then we're going to send aoy world and then we're going to send aoy world and then we're going to send it I'm going to send it to my phone it I'm going to send it to my phone it I'm going to send it to my phone number um so this is this is one of number um so this is this is one of number um so this is this is one of those numbers that you verified right when you created your account you verified you had a number so my phone verified you had a number so my phone verified you had a number so my phone number is 432 527 4274 don't text too number is 432 527 4274 don't text too number is 432 527 4274 don't text too late at night please um and then the late at night please um and then the late at night please um and then the final thing that we have here is this final thing that we have here is this final thing that we have here is this off token now this is a very private key off token now this is a very private key off token now this is a very private key right we don't ever want anybody to have right we don't ever want anybody to have right we don't ever want anybody to have access this is like that Spotify token access this is like that Spotify token access this is like that Spotify token that we had right we don't ever want that we had right we don't ever want that we had right we don't ever want anybody to have it I am going to I trust anybody to have it I am going to I trust anybody to have it I am going to I trust you uh and I'm going to go ahead and I'm you uh and I'm going to go ahead and I'm you uh and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to paste that here uh so that we going to paste that here uh so that we going to paste that here uh so that we have it so um uh that is uh something have it so um uh that is uh something have it so um uh that is uh something that you never want to let out because that you never want to let out because that you never want to let out because now you could seeing this on my screen now you could seeing this on my screen now you could seeing this on my screen you could use this right um and uh you could use this right um and uh you could use this right um and uh you probably don't want anybody doing that so you never want to actually give that so you never want to actually give that so you never want to actually give that number out you want to hide that uh and number out you want to hide that uh and number out you want to hide that uh and we'll talk about how to do that uh more we'll talk about how to do that uh more we'll talk about how to do that uh more here in the future but right now I just here in the future but right now I just here in the future but right now I just wanted to show you we're going to use wanted to show you we're going to use wanted to show you we're going to use Curl we are going to create we're going Curl we are going to create we're going Curl we are going to create we're going to send a post to this URL here and to send a post to this URL here and to send a post to this URL here and you'll notice that ends in Json so you'll notice that ends in Json so you'll notice that ends in Json so that's what we're going to get back that's what we're going to get back that's what we're going to get back that's the way that that it works this that's the way that that it works this that's the way that that it works this is to my account my account Sid you see is to my account my account Sid you see is to my account my account Sid you see it starts with this AC um and and we're going to post uh using um and and we're going to post uh using um and and we're going to post uh using this data URL encode so the way that the this data URL encode so the way that the this data URL encode so the way that the twio API works is it takes um some twio API works is it takes um some twio API works is it takes um some parameters it takes from body and to and parameters it takes from body and to and parameters it takes from body and to and the way that you pass those in curl is the way that you pass those in curl is the way that you pass those in curl is with this Das Das data URL encode and with this Das Das data URL encode and with this Das Das data URL encode and you pass what it is uh that you want to you pass what it is uh that you want to you pass what it is uh that you want to have uh go across here so we're going to have uh go across here so we're going to have uh go across here so we're going to if all of this works I should get a if all of this works I should get a if all of this works I should get a message back uh I should get a text message back uh I should get a text message back uh I should get a text message on my actual phone uh that says message on my actual phone uh that says message on my actual phone uh that says aoy world let's do and it looks like I'm missing a quote and it looks like I'm missing a quote someplace so where is the quote that I'm [Music] quote if I can go press the up Arrow quote if I can go press the up Arrow quote if I can go press the up Arrow maybe it will show up yeah oh right you maybe it will show up yeah oh right you maybe it will show up yeah oh right you know how many times I do that the aoy know how many times I do that the aoy know how many times I do that the aoy world the exclamation point uh is is uh world the exclamation point uh is is uh world the exclamation point uh is is uh something you need to typically Escape so I'm just going to say a Hoy world so I'm just going to say a Hoy world so I'm just going to say a Hoy world with a single quote there so if uh if with a single quote there so if uh if with a single quote there so if uh if you're having that problem sorry that's what that was so I pressed the up Arrow what that was so I pressed the up Arrow what that was so I pressed the up Arrow to get my information back uh there and to get my information back uh there and to get my information back uh there and now if all is going well and I press s now if all is going well and I press s now if all is going well and I press s we should get a text here we go and so I we should get a text here we go and so I we should get a text here we go and so I got this message back I got this and got this message back I got this and got this message back I got this and sure enough here it is I got it and you sure enough here it is I got it and you sure enough here it is I got it and you can see here it says at the front of the can see here it says at the front of the can see here it says at the front of the body that it sent it says ay it says a body that it sent it says ay it says a body that it sent it says ay it says a scent from your Twi trial account which scent from your Twi trial account which scent from your Twi trial account which is fine we're in a trial account that's is fine we're in a trial account that's is fine we're in a trial account that's totally fine but I did and boom I got it totally fine but I did and boom I got it totally fine but I did and boom I got it on my actual phone I got that message on my actual phone I got that message on my actual phone I got that message which is awesome we now have the ability which is awesome we now have the ability which is awesome we now have the ability uh to send a text message from the uh to send a text message from the uh to send a text message from the command line right that's pretty cool let's take this a step further cool let's take this a step further cool let's take this a step further actually so we know that uh that that actually so we know that uh that that actually so we know that uh that that API when I did a a post I was able to uh API when I did a a post I was able to uh API when I did a a post I was able to uh get information back I'm going to go get information back I'm going to go get information back I'm going to go ahead now and I'm going to do uh just ahead now and I'm going to do uh just ahead now and I'm going to do uh just bring that back and I'm going to get rid bring that back and I'm going to get rid bring that back and I'm going to get rid of all of these parameters here um I'm of all of these parameters here um I'm of all of these parameters here um I'm going to get rid of the from the body going to get rid of the from the body going to get rid of the from the body and the two and I'm going to change I'm and the two and I'm going to change I'm and the two and I'm going to change I'm going to make that I'm going to do a going to make that I'm going to do a going to make that I'm going to do a get and let me show you what that looks get and let me show you what that looks get and let me show you what that looks like so I'm going to get rid of all of like so I'm going to get rid of all of like so I'm going to get rid of all of those parameters I'm going to keep that those parameters I'm going to keep that those parameters I'm going to keep that same URL and it still has my account Sid same URL and it still has my account Sid same URL and it still has my account Sid there right in there and uh instead of a there right in there and uh instead of a there right in there and uh instead of a post what we're going to do is we're post what we're going to do is we're post what we're going to do is we're going to do a get what we should do is going to do a get what we should do is going to do a get what we should do is we should get back all of the messages we should get back all of the messages we should get back all of the messages that are there so I'm going to hit this that are there so I'm going to hit this that are there so I'm going to hit this kind of like a message log right so kind of like a message log right so kind of like a message log right so these are all the messages that have these are all the messages that have these are all the messages that have been sent uh which is awesome here it is been sent uh which is awesome here it is been sent uh which is awesome here it is sent from your toio trial account so and sent from your toio trial account so and sent from your toio trial account so and actually I can make this look a little actually I can make this look a little actually I can make this look a little bit prettier like we saw with JQ again bit prettier like we saw with JQ again bit prettier like we saw with JQ again totally optional in the notes if you totally optional in the notes if you totally optional in the notes if you want it yeah there we go so you can see want it yeah there we go so you can see want it yeah there we go so you can see that um I've got some information uh that um I've got some information uh that um I've got some information uh that's sent back here and you can see that's sent back here and you can see that's sent back here and you can see that the the message that was sent it that the the message that was sent it that the the message that was sent it was sent outbound uh to my phone number was sent outbound uh to my phone number was sent outbound uh to my phone number to me from that number uh which is to me from that number uh which is to me from that number uh which is awesome right and uh like I said curl is awesome right and uh like I said curl is awesome right and uh like I said curl is a little bit uh challenging because it's a little bit uh challenging because it's a little bit uh challenging because it's going to be a little bit different if going to be a little bit different if going to be a little bit different if you're in uh Microsoft Windows or if you're in uh Microsoft Windows or if you're in uh Microsoft Windows or if you're in Mac I tried to make that as you're in Mac I tried to make that as you're in Mac I tried to make that as comfortable as possible but you saw that comfortable as possible but you saw that comfortable as possible but you saw that I did run into a couple of things like I did run into a couple of things like I did run into a couple of things like I couldn't use the exclamation point and things like that um it's a little clumsy things like that um it's a little clumsy things like that um it's a little clumsy so um stay tuned because there are more so um stay tuned because there are more so um stay tuned because there are more tools coming your way awesome job getting that running from your local machine it feels pretty good doesn't it machine it feels pretty good doesn't it machine it feels pretty good doesn't it what a cool skill you have now you can what a cool skill you have now you can what a cool skill you have now you can send a text message from your machine send a text message from your

iceberg me this is just the tip of the iceberg me this is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do there are so many of what you can do there are so many of what you can do there are so many more twio apis available and now I know more twio apis available and now I know more twio apis available and now I know that you can explore them with curl for that you can explore them with curl for that you can explore them with curl for now though let's take things another step deeper now I don't know about you step deeper now I don't know about you step deeper now I don't know about you but I'm a little clumsy when it comes to but I'm a little clumsy when it comes to but I'm a little clumsy when it comes to Long commands on the terminal like we Long commands on the terminal like we Long

my hands dirty and organize my learnings one of the most famous tools and one of the most famous tools and one of the most famous tools and one that you've probably already heard of is that you've probably already heard of is that you've probably already heard of is called Postman do you get it Postman in addition to being a pretty Postman in addition to being a pretty Postman in addition to being a pretty good Pun It's also a Powerhouse of good Pun It's also a Powerhouse of good Pun It's also a Powerhouse of features Postman started as a Chrome extension that let you make API calls

Enterprise ready tool with all sorts of Enterprise ready tool with all sorts of Enterprise ready tool with all sorts of bells and whistles and even sharable collections for the most popular apis that are out out there it's jam-packed that are out out there it's jam-packed that are out out there it's jam-packed full of features and in my humble full of features and in my humble full of features and in my humble opinion you probably don't need all that opinion you probably don't need all that opinion you probably don't need all that just yet in your Learning Journey there just yet in your

I've linked to a few wield its power and I've linked to a few wield its power and I've linked to a few of those in the notes there are other of those in the notes there are other of those in the notes there are other tools popping up all the time that allow tools popping up all the time that allow tools popping up all the time that allow you to explore apis and store your notes you to explore apis and store your notes you to explore apis and store your notes I like to think of these apps as the I like to think of these apps as the I like to think of these apps as the built-in the vein of Postman there's a built-in the vein of Postman there's a built-in the vein of Postman there's a whole genre of video games that gets whole genre of video games that gets whole genre of video games that gets dubbed Metroid Vania because they're similar to Metroid and Castlevania now these apps are Postman post Postman esque let me show Postman post Postman esque let me show Postman post Postman esque let me show you an example I just bought this lamp you an example I just bought this lamp you an example I just bought this lamp here it's rad it's from GOI and it's got here it's rad it's from GOI and it's got here it's rad it's from GOI and it's got this app that I can use to control it on this app that I can use to control it on this app that I can use to control it on my phone I can change the colors right my phone I can change the colors right my phone I can change the colors right and I can even make it dance to my beatbox it also has an API these are the beatbox it also has an API these are the docs here and as I explore these docks docs here and as I explore these docks docs here and as I explore these docks uh I'm going to save them in one of uh I'm going to save them in one of uh I'm going to save them in one of these Postman esque tools that I've been these Postman esque tools that I've been these Postman esque tools that I've been using lately called rest Fox like here I can see all of the Fox like here I can see all of the Fox like here I can see all of the devices that are associated with my GOI devices that are associated with my GOI devices that are associated with my GOI account and I set that up using this URL account and I set that up using this URL account and I set that up using this URL here and you'll see that it is a get here and you'll see that it is a get here and you'll see that it is a get request and I pressed send and it sent request and I pressed send and it sent request and I pressed send and it sent the request and I got back uh the goie the request and I got back uh the goie the request and I got back uh the goie devices that are associated with my account this API requires a header and account this API requires a header and account this API requires a header and it's called goie API key and you'll see it's called goie API key and you'll see it's called goie API key and you'll see these double mustaches here that I'm using this side little mustache thing uh using this side little mustache thing uh using this side little mustache thing uh this is getting things from my environment as a special key that I environment as a special key that I environment as a special key that I don't want anybody to see I'll show you don't want anybody to see I'll show you don't want anybody to see I'll show you more of those here in a bit now notice more of those here in a bit now notice more of those here in a bit now notice how this is a get so I can send the how this is a get so I can send the how this is a get so I can send the request and you'll see that here's my request and you'll see that here's my request and you'll see that here's my response and I can also get the current response and I can also get the current response and I can also get the current state so I have a different call here I state so I have a different call here I state so I have a different call here I can get the current state and note that can get the current state and note that can get the current state and note that uh if I click Send here we can see that uh if I click Send here we can see that uh if I click Send here we can see that this is the color of my light currently this is the color of my light currently this is the color of my light currently and I can also uh turn it on or turn it and I can also uh turn it on or turn it and I can also uh turn it on or turn it off and I can turn it on and I can also change the color right on and I can also change the color right on and I can also change the color right so I'm going to turn this to to Red you so I'm going to turn this to to Red you so I'm going to turn this to to Red you don't have to turn the red light on don't have to turn the red light on don't have to turn the red light on roxan pretty cool right and I have this roxan pretty cool right and I have this roxan pretty cool right and I have this here for me whenever I want to tweak here for me whenever I want to tweak here for me whenever I want to tweak things when I want to come back later things when I want to come back later things when I want to come back later and when I want to use it in my code did and when I want to use it in my code did and when I want to use it in my code did you just have a light bulb moment I you just have a light bulb moment I you just have a light bulb moment I quite literally just did let's see if we quite literally just did let's see if we quite literally just did let's see if we can't build one of these for the twilio can't build one of these for the twilio can't build one of these for the twilio apis so if you'd like to get rest Fox apis so if you'd like to get rest Fox apis so if you'd like to get rest Fox installed please uh check the notes this installed please uh check the notes this installed please uh check the notes this is an open source tool and it's getting is an open source tool and it's getting is an open source tool and it's getting better every day now if you love it too better every day now if you love it too better every day now if you love it too I highly suggest that you start it if I highly suggest that you start it

client I guess maybe that's a little bit better guess maybe that's a little bit better guess maybe that's a little bit better than my Metroid Vania analogy uh maybe than my Metroid Vania analogy uh maybe than my Metroid Vania analogy uh maybe rest client is a good thing API client rest client is a good thing API client rest client is a good thing API client that's also a good thing so there's lots that's also a good thing so there's lots that's also a good thing so there's lots of these tools uh that are available but of these tools uh that are available but of these tools uh that are available but let's start using this one so I've got let's start using this one so I've got let's start using this one so I've got rest fox running here and you'll see rest fox running here and you'll see rest fox running here and you'll see I've got the goie folder which I can I've got the goie folder which I can I've got the goie folder which I can collapse and typically what I do is group these and typically what I do is group these and typically what I do is group these by the API that I'm exploring so let's by the API that I'm exploring so let's by the API that I'm exploring so let's keep poking around a little bit with keep poking around a little bit with keep poking around a little bit with twilio so uh what I'll do is I'll make a twilio so uh what I'll do is I'll make a twilio so uh what I'll do is I'll make a new folder called twilio so I'm going to new folder called twilio so I'm going to new folder called twilio so I'm going to right click over here and make a new right click over here and make a new right click over here and make a new folder called twilio and now in here we'll create a twilio and now in here we'll create a twilio and now in here we'll create a new request so I right clicked new request so I right clicked new request so I right clicked new request and I'd love to explore more of request and I'd love to explore more of request and I'd love to explore more of the SMS API so let's see uh oh you know the SMS API so let's see uh oh you know the SMS API so let's see uh oh you know what this new number that we just bought what this new number that we just bought what this new number that we just bought this twilio number that we bought not this twilio number that we bought not this twilio number that we bought not not only can It send messages but it can not only can It send messages but it can not only can It send messages but it can also receive them so we could send it a also receive them so we could send it a also receive them so we could send it a message so let's do that so let's go message so let's do that so let's go message so let's do that so let's go ahead and send a text to your number now ahead and send a text to your number now ahead and send a text to your number now if you forgot your number it's uh over if you forgot your number it's uh over if you forgot your number it's uh over in your console so if you come to your in your console so if you come to your in your console so if you come to your console and you scroll down a little bit console and you scroll down a little bit console and you scroll down a little bit here you'll see my twilio number so go here you'll see my twilio number so go here you'll see my twilio number so go ahead and send uh a text to your number ahead and send uh a text to your number ahead and send uh a text to your number now my number I'm going to send a number now my number I'm going to send a number now my number I'm going to send a number it's 561 81654 33 I'm going to send it it's 561 81654 33 I'm going to send it it's 561 81654 33 I'm going to send it yo and uh uh there we go it went and I yo and uh uh there we go it went and I yo and uh uh there we go it went and I ended up getting a default message back ended up getting a default message back ended up getting a default message back um and we could change this we can make um and we could change this we can make um and we could change this we can make we could program this to do whatever uh we could program this to do whatever uh we could program this to do whatever uh but I'll show that off later but for now but I'll show that off later but for now but I'll show that off later but for now uh I just want you to know that we uh I just want you to know that we uh I just want you to know that we created a new message uh by sending to created a new message uh by sending to created a new message uh by sending to this this API and we can actually get it this this API and we can actually get it this this API and we can actually get it um and you can also find your phone um and you can also find your phone um and you can also find your phone number later here under this phone numbers if you go to phone numbers if you go to phone numbers if you go to phone numbers manage active numbers uh you can see manage active numbers uh you can see manage active numbers uh you can see your phone number and remember outside of trial mode you could buy multiple of trial mode you could buy multiple of trial mode you could buy multiple numbers so that's an important uh thing numbers so that's an important uh thing numbers so that's an important uh thing to know here so all right so we're going to look at so all right so we're going to look at so all right so we're going to look at the incoming messages so uh we should do the incoming messages so uh we should do the incoming messages so uh we should do that we should call the request what that we should call the request what that we should call the request what it's going to be we'll call this it's going to be we'll call this it's going to be we'll call this incoming message log that sounds good and we'll click create okay so let's head over to the create okay so let's head over to the create okay so let's head over to the docs and see how we might do this with docs and see how we might do this with docs and see how we might do this with so back in the docs here on the message so back in the docs here on the message so back in the docs here on the message resource remember this is where we did resource remember this is where we did resource remember this is where we did the create a message I'm going to see if the create a message I'm going to see if the create a message I'm going to see if there's something else down in here ah there's something else down in here ah there's something else down in here ah list all messages that's a good one list all messages that's a good one list all messages that's a good one but we don't want all of the messages we but we don't want all of the messages we but we don't want all of the messages we actually want to filter it a little bit actually want to filter it a little bit actually want to filter it a little bit so look here we can do this by by so look here we can do this by by so look here we can do this by by matching filter criteria that's great so we're in here I'm under the curl tab we're in here I'm under the curl tab we're in here I'm under the curl tab right I could be in these different ones right I could be in these different ones right I could be in these different ones but this this is the example that we but this this is the example that we but this this is the example that we want here I'm going to grab this URL want here I'm going to grab this URL want here I'm going to grab this URL you're going to see all of this that's you're going to see all of this that's you're going to see all of this that's how they're filtering there's some stuff here at the end I'm going to grab all of here at the end I'm going to grab all of here at the end I'm going to grab all of this and I'm going to copy it I'm gonna this and I'm going to copy it I'm gonna this and I'm going to copy it I'm gonna come back over and I am going to uh come back over and I am going to uh come back over and I am going to uh paste it here in this enter request URL paste it here in this enter request URL paste it here in this enter request URL I'm going to paste the whole thing there I'm going to paste the whole thing there I'm going to paste the whole thing there and it was a get request and uh the URL and it was a get request and uh the URL and it was a get request and uh the URL had some stuff in this query string that had some stuff in this query string that had some stuff in this query string that came afterwards and a query string uh is came afterwards and a query string uh is came afterwards and a query string uh is you know defined by this question mark you know defined by this question mark you know defined by this question mark so we don't want this date sent let's so we don't want this date sent let's so we don't want this date sent let's get rid of this and what's next we don't get rid of this and what's next we don't get rid of this and what's next we don't we don't want from right we don't we don't want from right we don't we don't want from right we don't we want to look at all the numbers that want to look at all the numbers that want to look at all the numbers that were was sent to right so this is the were was sent to right so this is the were was sent to right so this is the two here is what we want now this 2B here just happens to be a uh now this 2B here just happens to be a uh now this 2B here just happens to be a uh percent 2B URL and Coda happens to be a percent 2B URL and Coda happens to be a percent 2B URL and Coda happens to be a plus and I know that and I just happen plus and I know that and I just happen plus and I know that and I just happen to know that without having to Google it to know that without having to Google it to know that without having to Google it but that's that's a little rough to know but that's that's a little rough to know but that's that's a little rough to know like how do I make a plus sign in in like how do I make a plus sign in in like how do I make a plus sign in in here um wouldn't it be nice if this tool here um wouldn't it be nice if this tool here um wouldn't it be nice if this tool just did all of this URL encoding for us just did all of this URL encoding for us just did all of this URL encoding for us like we didn't need to make this mess at like we didn't need to make this mess at like we didn't need to make this mess at the end well check this out here's query the end well check this out here's query the end well check this out here's query right here this is what we want so we right here this is what we want so we right here this is what we want so we want to add this query we don't want to add this query we don't want to add this query we don't want to have this whole stuff at the end here we have this whole stuff at the end here we have this whole stuff at the end here we want to put in uh two we're going to add want to put in uh two we're going to add want to put in uh two we're going to add uh one of those things there we'll put uh one of those things there we'll put uh one of those things there we'll put in a two so that's going to append that in a two so that's going to append that in a two so that's going to append that query string for me and I'm going to put query string for me and I'm going to put query string for me and I'm going to put in uh uh the to my phone number which in uh uh the to my phone number which in uh uh the to my phone number which again my willo phone number uh which is again my willo phone number uh which is again my willo phone number uh which is over here in my logs uh right here actually I can I'm logs uh right here actually I can I'm logs uh right here actually I can I'm going to grab this number this is my my going to grab this number this is my my going to grab this number this is my my twilio number I'm going to put it in the twilio number I'm going to put it in the twilio number I'm going to put it in the format uh that is wanted there my rest format uh that is wanted there my rest format uh that is wanted there my rest Fox here we go so I'm gon to that and Fox here we go so I'm gon to that and Fox here we go so I'm gon to that and we're going to get rid of make sure we're going to get rid of make sure we're going to get rid of make sure that's 1561 there we go got rid of all that's 1561 there we go got rid of all that's 1561 there we go got rid of all those all right now also remember that this was right now also remember that this was right now also remember that this was accounts and then it had account Sid accounts and then it had account Sid accounts and then it had account Sid right so that's the the ID for my right so that's the the ID for my right so that's the the ID for my account and then it's under messages there's a collection called messages underneath this count Sid but what we underneath this count Sid but what we underneath this count Sid but what we want here is we want that was uh using want here is we want that was uh using want here is we want that was uh using an environment variable from curl um but an environment variable from curl um but an environment variable from curl um but this is also known as a path variable this is also known as a path variable this is also known as a path variable right a path parameter so here down here right a path parameter so here down here right a path parameter so here down here we have this path parameters so the way we have this path parameters so the way we have this path parameters so the way that these work actually uh to to that these work actually uh to to that these work actually uh to to replace them is if we go like this if I replace them is if we go like this if I replace them is if we go like this if I get rid of this and I put a Col in get rid of this and I put a Col in get rid of this and I put a Col in what's going to happen is we can what's going to happen is we can what's going to happen is we can anything that's down here in this path anything that's down here in this path anything that's down here in this path parameter will replace what's here so let's do that let's add this item and let's do that let's add this item and let's do that let's add this item and again that is twilio account Sid so again that is twilio account Sid so again that is twilio account Sid so that's the name of the the the variable that's the name of the the the variable that's the name of the the the variable that's up here right is col and twio that's up here right is col and twio that's up here right is col and twio account Sid that was just what's there account Sid that was just what's there account Sid that was just what's there let's keep it because that's what it is let's keep it because that's what it is let's keep it because that's what it is and then we're going to put our account and then we're going to put our account and then we're going to put our account Sid there so that also is on my console Sid there so that also is on my

of the things that you could do and one of the things that you could do is see the messages that were sent in is see the messages that were sent in is see the messages that were sent in and look there's my yo my yo message has and look there's my yo my yo message has and look there's my yo my yo message has made it in um awesome so uh also I made it in um awesome so uh also I made it in um awesome so uh also I wanted to show you the request that wanted to show you the request that wanted to show you the request that happened let's take a look at that you happened let's take a look at that you happened let's take a look at that you can see that what actually happened was can see that what actually happened was can see that what actually happened was it was a get that was sent with the it was a get that was sent with the it was a get that was sent with the account Sid right and so that was the account Sid right and so that was the account Sid right and so that was the account Sid that we used from if we look account Sid that we used from if we look account Sid that we used from if we look back at the query parameters here the back at the query parameters here the back at the query parameters here the account Sid uh showed up there and then account Sid uh showed up there and then account Sid uh showed up there and then uh it automatically did a two URL uh it automatically did a two URL uh it automatically did a two URL encoded and if you look it put the encoded and if you look it put the encoded and if you look it put the question mark in for us and it did that question mark in for us and it did that question mark in for us and it did that percent 2B for us automatically URL encoded very nice right and we can see the headers that right and we can see the headers that were sent and we can also take a look were sent and we can also take a look were sent and we can also take a look let's look again at this preview so we let's look again at this preview so we let's look again at this preview so we see that we had a the the response came see that we had a the the response came see that we had a the the response came back and this is Json right so we have a back and this is Json right so we have a back and this is Json right so we have a key called messages and this messages has this uh it starts out there could be has this uh it starts out there could be has this uh it starts out there could be multiple messages here right so this is multiple messages here right so this is multiple messages here right so this is a the start of what's known as a list or a the start of what's known as a list or a the start of what's known as a list or an array and then there's an object and an array and then there's an object and an array and then there's an object and the start of the object is always done the start of the object is always done the start of the object is always done with one of these mustaches and we call with one of these mustaches and we call with one of these mustaches and we call those mustaches because if you kind of those mustaches because if you kind of those mustaches because if you kind of turn your head sideways it it looks like turn your head sideways it it looks like turn your head sideways it it looks like a mustache so uh all between the opening a mustache so uh all between the opening a mustache so uh all between the opening mustache and the closing mustache uh is mustache and the closing mustache uh is mustache and the closing mustache uh is the information about um the mesages right so here's the and there's the right so here's the and there's the right so here's the and there's the closing uh bit of my list there's only closing uh bit of my list there's only closing uh bit of my

uh are they are Json based so uh this is they are Json based so uh this is they are Json based so uh this is remember this is the start of an object remember this is the start of an object remember this is the start of an object now if you've never WR written Json now if you've never WR written Json now if you've never WR written Json before take your time use some patience before take your time use some patience before take your time use some patience one of the things that you could do is one of the things that you could do is one of the things that you could do is you can come in and you

so come over here I'm going to nice so come over here I'm going to paste that and now I want to add a new paste that and now I want to add a new paste that and now I want to add a new key so the way Json works is you put a key so the way Json works is you put a key so the way Json works is you put a comma after that right and I'm going to comma after that right and I'm going to comma after that right and I'm going to put a new uh the key here and we'll do put a new uh the key here and we'll do put a new uh the key here and we'll do AO uh account or offen and again this is uh that can be

to go change each one of them but have to go change each one of them but now I have one place where it's defined now I have one place where it's defined now I have one place where it's defined I have one place in my environment I have one place in my environment I have one place in my environment that's defined so I have this environment here that says quo now instead of user name I can do this instead of user name I can do this instead of user name I can do this mustache mustache and I can say twio uh account Sid and uh that's the twio uh account Sid and uh that's the twio uh account Sid and uh that's the way the templating language works here and in most of these rest clients um and in most of these rest clients um and in most of these rest clients um and you can do uho uh token so when you see that that's uho uh token so when you see that that's uho uh token so when you see that that's what's happening that is the environment it's using the environment variables I'm going to go do that for here and also going to go do that for here and also going to go do that for here and also I'm going to copy my off token for here I'm going to copy my off token for here I'm going to copy

we have a collection of collection so we have a collection of accounts and here's a specific account we have a collection that account has we have a collection that account has we have a collection that account has messages uh that uh message has media messages uh that uh message has media messages uh that uh message has media and that media has an entry a media and that media has an entry a

pretty cool the way that this that's pretty cool the way that this that's pretty cool the way that this works is if I get this I can get some works is if I get this I can get some works is if I get this I can get some metadata information about it but if I metadata information about it but if I metadata information about it but if I get just a little bit of it if I just go get just a little bit of it if I just go get just a little bit of it if I just go ahead and take this the way that the way ahead and take this the way that the way ahead and take this the way that the way that twilio works and not not all AP that twilio works and not not all AP that twilio works and not not all AP apis do this but if I do this without apis do this but if I do this without apis do this but if I do this without the extension here I'll actually get back the picture that I sent so I'm back the picture that I sent so I'm back the picture that I sent so I'm going to do that I'm going to make a new going to do that I'm going to make a new going to do that I'm going to make a new a new little request here so uh new a new little request here so uh new a new little request here so uh new request and uh we're going to call this request and uh we're going to call this request and uh we're going to call this uh get the pick right we're going to get uh get the pick right we're going to get uh get the

twilio.com and uh the interesting thing about this and uh the interesting thing about this and uh the interesting thing about this is this pick is not authenticated and if is this pick is not authenticated and if is this pick is not authenticated and if you do authenticate you end up actually you do authenticate you end up actually you do authenticate you end up actually having some problems so I'm going to having some problems so I'm going to having some problems so I'm going to tell this request specifically to not inherit value so I'm going to disable inherit value so I'm going to disable inherit value so I'm going to disable this so that it's not authenticated so this so that it's not authenticated so this so that it's not authenticated so when I click this if all goes well we when I click this if all goes well we when I click this if all goes well we should see the pick that I submitted should see the pick that I submitted should see the pick that I submitted awesome and we do uh cool so um it's a awesome and we do uh cool so um it's a awesome and we do uh cool so um it's a little big it's a little bit of of a little big it's a little bit of of a little big it's a little bit of of a pick um that was sent here um and uh we pick um that was sent here um and uh we pick um that was sent here um and uh we could take a look at some stuff here we could take a look at some stuff here we could take a look at some stuff here we could look at the headers that were sent could look at the headers that were sent could look at the headers that were sent so we can see a couple things one of the so we can see a couple things one of the so we can see a couple things one of the things that I think is really interesting is when it says last modified so uh the last modified date if modified so uh the last modified date if modified so uh the last modified date if you have a request that has this on it you have a request that has this on it you have a request that has this on it it means that you can use caching so you it means that you can use caching so you it means that you can use caching so you can uh when you make the request you can uh when you make the request you can uh when you make the request you can actually say if it's been modified since actually say if it's been modified since actually say if it's been modified since this time I do that so I'm going to do this time I do that so I'm going to do this time I do that so I'm going to do that I'm going to grab this let's let's that I'm going to grab this let's let's that I'm going to grab this let's let's just take a look and see what that does just take a look and see what that does just take a look and see what that does so I'm going to go to headers here and so I'm going to go to headers here and so I'm going to go to headers here and I'm going to put a new header in here of I'm going to put a new header in here of I'm going to put a new header in here of if and you can see that there's if and you can see that there's if and you can see that there's autocomplete so it's if modified since so again this is the request that I am so again this is the request that I am so again this is the request that I am making I'm making this request and I'm making I'm making this request and I'm making I'm making this request and I'm going to say if it's been modified since going to say if it's been modified since going to say if it's been modified since then uh uh give me it otherwise uh let then uh uh give me it otherwise uh let then uh uh give me it otherwise uh let me know and so the way that it lets you me know and so the way that it lets you me know and so the way that it lets you know um is 304 not modified so that's a know um is 304 not modified so that's a know um is 304 not modified so that's a status and you'll see that I got zero status and you'll see that I got zero status and you'll see that I got zero bytes back so that is how caching Works bytes back so that is how caching Works bytes back so that is how caching Works um and what you can do to to send this um and what you can do to to send this um and what you can do to to send this across so so this is really powerful across so so this is really powerful across so so this is really powerful right I didn't need to set up all the right I didn't need to set up all the right I didn't need to set up all the other things and it's kind of really a other things and it's kind of really a other things and it's kind of really a quick little uh look at this I don't quick little uh look at this I don't quick little uh look at this I don't actually even need to do a collection I actually even need to do a collection I actually even need to do a collection I can just do a new request outside of it can just do a new request outside of it can just do a new request outside of it and I kind of explore through and see and I kind of explore through and see and I kind of explore through and see how these things are working which ding how these things are working which ding how these things are working which ding ding ding means we covered another part ding ding means we covered another part ding ding means we covered another part of a restful API constraint scavenger hunt using standard h to be caching hunt using standard h to be caching hunt using standard h to be caching mechanisms like last modified and eags a mechanisms like last modified and eags a mechanisms like last modified and eags a restful API should support caching it's up to you to maintain the cach on your up to you to maintain the cach on your up to you to maintain the cach on your client and decorate your quests but this client and decorate your quests but this client and decorate your quests but this can come in really handy to avoid making can come in really handy to avoid making can come in really handy to avoid making unneeded requests and those are the the unneeded requests and those are the the unneeded requests and those are the the postman esque things I wanted you to see postman esque things I wanted you to see postman esque things I wanted you to see I wanted you to be able to do that I wanted you to be able to do that I wanted you to be able to do that without diving in necessarily to do all without diving in necessarily to do all without diving in necessarily to do all of the postman Enterprise uh things that of the postman Enterprise uh things that of the postman Enterprise uh things that you want to do but I think it's time I you want to do but I think it's time I you want to do but I think it's time I think you should feel comfortable enough that we can now look at Postman and see that we can now look at Postman and see that we can now look at Postman and see what we've already learned there so I'm what we've already learned there so I'm what we've already learned there so I'm going to go uh here and I'm going to go uh here and I'm going to go uh here and I'm going to just do a quick quick little Google just do a quick quick little Google just do a quick quick little Google search for Postman um and this is really search for Postman um and this is really search for Postman um and this is really nice you can do this for whatever API nice you can do this for whatever API nice you can do this for whatever API you're working with and since we're working with twio I'm going to search working with twio I'm going to search working with twio I'm going to search for the postman twilio collection um so for the postman twilio collection um so for the postman twilio collection um so there's some docs on twilio about it but there's some docs on twilio about it but there's some docs on twilio about it but if you look here there's this twilio if you look here there's this twilio if you look here there's this twilio postman on the API Network so this is postman on the API Network so this is postman on the API Network so this is important to know there's a lot of uh uh important to know there's a lot of uh uh important to know there's a lot of uh uh things on this API Network where they've things on this API Network where they've things on this API Network where they've built uh apis for you to go and share so built uh apis for you to go and share so built uh apis for you to go and share so I'm going to click this and now note I'm going to click this and now note I'm going to click this and now note I'm inside of a web browser postman's done a inside of a web browser postman's done a inside of a web browser postman's done a really gorgeous job of uh of letting you really gorgeous job of uh of letting you really gorgeous job of uh of letting you run inside of your browser you also can run inside of your browser you also can run inside of your browser you also can run it locally like we did with rest Fox run it locally like we did with rest Fox run it locally like we did with rest Fox um but I'm going to run this from my um but I'm going to run this from my um but I'm going to run this from my browser so I'm going to go into this browser so I'm going to go into this browser so I'm going to go into this messaging SMS uh and you can see there's all sorts SMS uh and you can see there's all sorts SMS uh and you can see there's all sorts of different things uh in here uh it's a of different things uh in here uh it's a of different things uh in here uh it's a little bit hard to get to here but you little bit hard to get to here but you little bit hard to get to here but you could change things put in your account could change things put in your account could change things put in your account it and and all sorts of things like we it and and all sorts of things like we it and and all sorts of things like we saw look here's the double mustaches right and here's a thing to send an SMS right and here's a thing to send an SMS right and here's a thing to send an SMS uh um and it's it's super cool um it uh um and it's it's super cool um it uh um and it's it's super cool um it it's it's neat right and so you've seen it's it's neat right and so you've seen it's it's neat right and so you've seen this here's your authorization headers the body there's Collections and uh what's cool is somebody's already built these collections for you and they're sharing your stuff this way right so sharing your stuff this way right so sharing your stuff this way right so that's kind of that's kind of nice so that's kind of that's kind of nice so that's kind of that's kind of nice so again there's path variables right and the path variables coming up here there's the the colon account Sid that there's the the colon account Sid that there's the the colon account Sid that you saw uh from before here somebody's you saw uh from before here somebody's you saw uh from before here somebody's using this as the start uh the https API using this as the start uh the https API using this as the start uh the https API t.com and it's doing a post right so it t.com and it's doing a post right so it t.com and it's doing a post right so it feels very similar so you're you're familiar with this there's also a bunch familiar with this there's also a bunch familiar with this there's also a bunch of other things over here that it can do of other things over here that it can do of other things over here that it can do that can get a little bit distracting that can get a little bit distracting that can get a little bit distracting and that's what I was trying to kind of and that's what I was trying to kind of and that's what I was trying to kind of avoid uh um because I wanted you to to avoid uh um because I wanted you to to avoid uh um because I wanted you to to get get familiar with it but know that get get familiar with it but know that get get familiar with it but know that this exists um one of the really cool this exists um one of the really cool this exists um one of the really cool things that Postman does is if you click things that Postman does is if you click things that Postman does is if you click over here on this far right over here on this far right over here on this far right over here there's this little uh code it's like there's this little uh code it's like there's this little uh code it's like open close tag this is really neat so um open close tag this is really neat so um open close tag this is really neat so um we have curl right so we can see this is we have curl right so we can see this is we have curl right so we can see this is how I would go ahead and do this and how I would go ahead and do this and how I would go ahead and do this and this this feels familiar right this is this this feels familiar right this is this this feels familiar right this is how what we actually did we did this how what we actually did we did this how what we actually did we did this curl statement but check this out you curl statement but check this out you curl statement but check this out you can do this in any programming language can do this in any programming language can do this in any programming language so the trick here the trick to remember so the trick here the trick to remember so the trick here the trick to remember is that any programming language that can make an HTTP request like it has a can make an HTTP request like it has a can make an HTTP request like it has a client built into it because these are client built into it because these are client built into it because these are all standard the rest API right we're all standard the rest API right we're all standard the rest API right we're following these constraints that have been defined it can generate code for been defined it can generate code for been defined it can generate code for you so here's nodejs using a package you so here's nodejs using a package you so here's nodejs using a package called axios so axios allows you to called axios so axios allows you to called axios so axios allows you to fetch things so this is what it would fetch things so this is what it would fetch things so this is what it would look like if you tried to write that look like if you tried to write that look like if you tried to write that using axios um and if you look at in using axios um and if you look at in using axios um and if you look at in here you come down here here it is in uh here you come down here here it is in uh here you come down here here it is in uh PHP with with guzzle I don't I don't PHP with with guzzle I don't I don't PHP with with guzzle I don't I don't know what guzzle is I like that though know what guzzle is I like that though know what guzzle is I like that though that's why I chose it um so you can see that's why I chose it um so you can see that's why I chose it um so you can see that it's generating this code for you that it's generating this code for you that it's generating this code for you and if I copied this and pasted it into and if I copied this and pasted it into and if I copied this and pasted it into my PHP code or my python code or my Java my PHP code or my python code or my Java my PHP code or my python code or my Java code it would just work and that's code it would just work and that's code it would just work and that's really handy that is if the company really handy that is if the company really handy that is if the company that's providing the API doesn't have a that's providing the API doesn't have a that's providing the API doesn't have a helper library or an SDK a software helper library or an SDK a software helper library or an SDK a software development kit which we haven't looked at yet but we're about ready to um at yet but we're about ready to um at yet but we're about ready to um twilio does have one of those but if you twilio does have one of those but if you twilio does have one of those but if you were looking at one of these that that were looking at one of these that that were looking at one of these that that didn't this is a great way to get code didn't this is a great way to get code didn't this is a great way to get code um so again check out the API network uh um so again check out the API network uh um so again check out the API network uh this Postman API Network it's cool I this Postman API Network it's cool I this Postman API Network it's cool I think you're ready now uh to use this if think you're ready now uh to use this if think you're ready now uh to use this if you want to but also feel free to use you want to but also feel free to use you want to but also feel free to use the other tools explore the apis in the other tools explore the apis in the other tools explore the apis in the in a in a comfortable way wherever you in a in a comfortable way wherever you in a in a comfortable way wherever you might be uh uh most comfortable with might be uh uh most comfortable with might be uh uh most comfortable with because there's all sorts of really fancy uh tools here on Postman and like fancy uh tools here on Postman and like fancy uh tools here on Postman and like I said there are courses on how to take I said there are courses on how to take I said there are courses on how to take full use of all of the things that are full use of all of the things that are full use of all of the things that are available awesome job diving into all those tools Postman is a super super those tools Postman is a super super those tools Postman is a super super powerful tool and it keeps getting better every day there are so many better every day there are so many better every day there are so many features that we didn't cover we barely features that we didn't cover we barely features that we didn't cover we barely even scratched the surface there's an entire course out there on it check the entire course out there on it check the entire course out there on it check the notes for where to see that we saw how to organize our requests that we saw how to organize our requests that we saw how to organize our requests together into collections as well as share common and secure values by using share common and secure values by using share common and secure values by using variables we learned how to add different values to requests both in form values query strings and headers and we also saw how to navigate through and we also saw how to navigate through and we also saw how to navigate through various sub resources via clicking URLs we even saw how to create actual we even saw how to create actual we even saw how to create actual runnable code from your request while we runnable code from your request while we runnable code from your request while we were in the twilio documentation you might have noticed the code examples on might have noticed the code examples on might have noticed the code examples on the screen on that page it's possible the screen on that page it's possible the screen on that page it's possible the tab between various language implementations and solutions many products offer what is known as an SDK products offer what is known as an SDK products offer what is known as an SDK or software development kit or helper library that allows you to interact with library that allows you to interact with library that allows you to interact with their product in your native language as their product in your native language as their product in your native language as you can see it abstracts away the rest you can see it abstracts away the rest you can see it abstracts away the rest API completely let's take a look at the API completely let's take a look at the API completely let's take a look at the twilio helper library next before that though just a quick reminder to make though just a quick reminder to make though just a quick reminder to make sure that you check the notes on this sure that you check the notes on this sure that you check the notes on this video there's a link to a repository of video there's a link to a repository of video there's a link to a repository of built out collections that are ready for built out collections that are ready for built out collections that are ready for you to use there are lots of great apis you to use there are lots of great apis you to use there are lots of great apis to practice with all the tools that we to practice with all the tools that we to practice with all the tools that we just looked at are great for accessing just looked at are great for accessing just looked at are great for accessing and exploring apis however when it comes and exploring apis however when it comes and exploring apis however when it comes time you're most likely going to want to time you're most likely going to want to time you're most likely going to want to write some code now as we saw in Postman write some code now as we saw in Postman write some code now as we saw in Postman you can actually generate code all programming languages have some sort of way of making HTTP requests and as you way of making HTTP requests and as you way of making HTTP requests and as you know HTTP requests are all we really know HTTP requests are all we really know HTTP requests are all we really need need to interact with rest apis so need need to interact with rest apis so need need to interact with rest apis so writing that sort of code is totally writing that sort of code is totally writing that sort of code is totally fine but you'll find that you'll end up fine but you'll find that you'll end up fine but you'll find that you'll end up writing a lot of what is known as writing a lot of what is known as writing a lot of what is known as boilerplate code by boilerplate I mean code that is repetitive and almost always the same just with a few tweaks always the same just with a few tweaks always the same just with a few tweaks many products and services have created a solution to help you avoid this a solution to help you avoid this a solution to help you avoid this problem they are often called helper libraries or sdks software development kits they'll be specific to your programming language these libraries help make your code more concise and help make your code more concise and help make your code more concise and legible they usually also provide additional documentation for your editor which I find super handy let's go check which I find super handy let's go check which I find super handy let's go check out some of these helper Library okay so out some of these helper Library okay so out some of these helper Library okay so let's take a look at one of these helper let's take a look at one of these helper let's take a look at one of these helper libraries let's take a look at the first libraries let's take a look at the first libraries let's take a look at the first one that's here so so again I'm in the one that's here so so again I'm in the one that's here so so again I'm in the docs SMS create a message resource I'm docs SMS create a message resource I'm docs SMS create a message resource I'm here under the curl tab currently remember we did this we went and we saw remember we did this we went and we saw remember we did this we went and we saw how to do this we passed the from the how to do this we passed the from the how to do this we passed the from the body and the two we passed in these body and the two we passed in these body and the two we passed in these environment variables as what this dollar is and this dollar toio ofok and dollar is and this dollar toio ofok and dollar is and this dollar toio ofok and their environment variables and it's also used here in the URL uh so we had also used here in the URL uh so we had also used here in the URL uh so we had done that we done that with curl now one done that we done that with curl now one done that we done that with curl now one of the really nice things um about these of the really nice things um about these of the really nice things um about these helper libraries is they look very similar but it's taken away this whole similar but it's taken away this whole similar but it's taken away this whole notion so let's let's go here I'm going notion so let's let's go here I'm going notion so let's let's go here I'm going to go to this nodejs now quick word of to go to this nodejs now quick word of to go to this nodejs now quick word of warning if JavaScript is new to you um warning if JavaScript is new to you um warning if JavaScript is new to you um there is some stuff here that might be a there is some stuff here that might be a there is some stuff here that might be a little confusing and I want this to just little confusing and I want this to just little confusing and I want this to just kind of kind of wash over you I want you kind of kind of wash over you I want you kind of kind of wash over you I want you to more feel what it feels like as I to more feel what it feels like as I to more feel what it feels like as I explain it and don't be too concerned explain it and don't be too concerned explain it and don't be too concerned with not exactly understanding all of the things that can happen especially if the things that can happen especially if the things that can happen especially if you're one of the folks who has the you're one of the folks who has the you're one of the folks who has the hello world uh requirement uh please don't feel like you need to fully don't feel like you need to fully don't feel like you need to fully understand all this I will walk through understand all this I will walk through understand all this I will walk through this code line by line and tell you what this code line by line and tell you what this code line by line and tell you what it's doing and it will be familiar to it's doing and it will be familiar to it's doing and it will be familiar to what we've been doing just in a what we've been doing just in a what we've been doing just in a programming language that you might not yet be familiar with so I'll take my yet be familiar with so I'll take my yet be familiar with so I'll take my time and you take your time give time and you take your time give time and you take your time give yourself some patience in fact I'd like yourself some patience in fact I'd like yourself some patience in fact I'd like to suggest that if you are in the boat to suggest that if you are in the boat to suggest that if you are in the boat where you have not written code like where you have not written code like where you have not written code like this before that you watch me first and this before that you watch me first and this before that you watch me first and then come back and do it later we're then come back and do it later we're then come back and do it later we're going to take advantage of the fact that going to take advantage of the fact that going to take advantage of the fact that we're in a video right you can take me we're in a video right you can take me we're in a video right you can take me right back to right right here it take right back to right right here it take right back to right right here it take me back to right here and we can get me back to right here and we can get me back to right here and we can get started so one of the things that I love started so one of the things that I love started so one of the things that I love about twilio's documentation is that you can just copy it and it should work so can just copy it and it should work so can just copy it and it should work so this is what was happening when we this is what was happening when we this is what was happening when we created something here right so we created a a message so this was uh you created a a message so this was uh you created a a message so this was uh you get this authenticated client right we know what that is we authenticate with know what that is we authenticate with know what that is we authenticate with our client uh with our with our account our client uh with our with our account our client uh with our with our account sit in our off token like we've been sit in our off token like we've been sit in our off token like we've been doing and then we're going to do this messages and then we're going to do this messages and then we're going to do this messages a client so

account sit and the off token we can do account sit and the off token we can do account sit and the off token we can do the same thing on our local machine we the same thing on our local machine we the same thing on our local machine we can set up a little environment here and can set up a little environment here and can set up a little environment here and actually if we go ahead and we click actually if we go ahead and we click actually if we go ahead and we click this filio secure there's some great examples in here on how you could do examples in here on how you could do examples in here on how you could do that so one of the things that this that so one of the things that this that so one of the things that this suggests doing um you can see it's for suggests doing um you can see it's for suggests doing um you can see it's for mac and Linux and different different shells have do different things um uh if shells have do different things um uh if shells have do different things um uh if you run this in your command line you run this in your command line you run this in your command line you can set your uh environment variables and then when you run node it will work and then when you run node it will work and then when you run node it will work uh I'm going to do I'm going to do this uh I'm going to do I'm going to do this uh I'm going to do I'm going to do this one so I'm going to copy copy this one so I'm going to copy copy this one so I'm going to copy copy this here and uh I am going to uh just paste this we'll paste this to uh just paste this we'll paste this to uh just paste this we'll paste this I'll show you show you what it does so I'll show you show you what it does so I'll show you show you what it does so uh I I it's it's saying we want to uh I I it's it's saying we want to uh I I it's it's saying we want to export my account Sid and my o token export my account Sid and my o token export my account Sid and my o token we're very familiar with these days so we're very familiar with these days so we're very familiar with these days so uh we're gonna we're GNA do that let's uh we're gonna we're GNA do that let's uh we're gonna we're GNA do that let's let's do this real quick so to pop in my account token there I'm so to pop in my account token there I'm so to pop in my account token there I'm going to go back over uh to my console going to go back over uh to my console going to go back over uh to my console scroll down and grab my account here and scroll down and grab my account here and scroll down and grab my account here and then I'm going to paste that and I am then I'm going to paste that and I am then I'm going to paste that and I am going to go and grab my off token and I going to go and grab my off token and I going to go and grab my off token and I am going uh to paste that so again I got am going uh to paste that so again I got am going uh to paste that so again I got to that oops accidentally pasted my off token in oops accidentally pasted my off token in oops accidentally pasted my off token in the wrong line there so I know that it the wrong line there so I know that it the wrong line there so I know that it started with a four and I'm going to started with a four and I'm going to started with a four and I'm going to paste it down here where it says your paste it down here where it says your paste it down here where it says your off token so basically what this is off token so basically what this is off token so basically what this is doing is this is writing a new file that doing is this is writing a new file that doing is this is writing a new file that will have this information I'll show you will have this information I'll show you will have this information I'll show you that here in a second so there's there's that here in a second so there's there's that here in a second so there's there's my um it's going to write these two my um it's going to write these two my um it's going to write these two lines I'll show you I'll show you what lines I'll show you I'll show you what lines I'll show you I'll show you what that looks like so I'm going to uh it's that looks like so I'm going to uh it's that looks like so I'm going to uh it's going to create a new file twio IM and going to create a new file twio IM and going to create a new file twio IM and it's going to appin that that's what it's going to appin that that's what it's going to appin that that's what this double-- twio IM and then it's this double-- twio IM and then it's this double-- twio IM and then it's going to source that which means uh put going to source that which means uh put going to source that which means uh put run that uh environment variable so uh run that uh environment variable so uh run that uh environment variable so uh if all is working well now if I say uh if all is working well now if I say uh if all is working well now if I say uh Echo and I can do twio account Sid um we can see that I have account Sid um we can see that I have account Sid um we can see that I have that available and that created this file here called twio IM and you can see file here called twio IM and you can see file here called twio IM and you can see there is my account sit in my token there is my account sit in my token there is my account sit in my token which is nice because now this code uh which is nice because now this code uh which is nice because now this code uh works it should be working using this works it should be working using this works it should be working using this and in fact if all is going right so and in fact if all is going right so and in fact if all is going right so I've I've got node installed I in I I've I've got node installed I in I I've I've got node installed I in I installed the helper Library um I put my installed the helper Library um I put my installed the helper Library um I put my account Sid uh from the console into this twio Sid uh from the console into this twio Sid uh from the console into this twio IM and then I did this final command IM and then I did this final command IM and then I did this final command here the source twio IM which will run here the source twio IM which will run here the source twio IM which will run that file and put those uh variables that file and put those uh variables that file and put those uh variables into my environment variables uh and as into my environment variables uh and as into my environment variables uh and as I showed you that they were working so I showed you that they were working so I showed you that they were working so so let's go ahead let's do node explore so let's go ahead let's do node explore so let's go ahead let's do node explore so what's going to happen let's take a so what's going to happen let's take a so what's going to happen let's take a look really quick I'll show you let's look really quick I'll show you let's look really quick I'll show you let's see let's make sure we got it working see let's make sure we got it working see let's make sure we got it working cool we did so so uh let's walk the code cool we did so so uh let's walk the code cool we did so so uh let's walk the code really quick so this is pasted straight really quick so this is pasted straight really quick so this is pasted straight from the uh straight from those docs so from the uh straight from those docs so from the uh straight from those docs so we're getting a client back um from this we're getting a client back um from this we're getting a client back um from this required twio this is a twilio library required twio this is a twilio library required twio this is a twilio library and when you get the twio library if you and when you get the twio library if you and when you get the twio library if you pass it in account Sid and an off token pass it in account Sid and an off token pass it in account Sid and an off token it'll automatically create a brand new rest client for you right so this is a rest client for you right so this is a rest client for you right so this is a client that you're able to use to hit client that you're able to use to hit client that you're able to use to hit the rest API at twilio and because it the rest API at twilio and because it the rest API at twilio and because it knows who you are it's able to access knows who you are it's able to access knows who you are it's able to access stuff on your half so very similar to stuff on your half so very similar to stuff on your half so very similar to what we're doing with the curl but this what we're doing with the curl but this what we're doing with the curl but this client we can use this multiple times um client we can use this multiple times um client we can use this multiple times um it will always be authentic so we're it will always be authentic so we're it will always be authentic so we're saying of all of the messages we want to saying of all of the messages we want to saying of all of the messages we want to list them all right so we want to get a list them all right so we want to get a list them all right so we want to get a list of all of the messages actually not list of all of the messages actually not list of all of the messages actually not all of them only 20 of those um so let's all of them only 20 of those um so let's all of them only 20 of those um so let's go ahead I'm going to just we know that go ahead I'm going to just we know that go ahead I'm going to just we know that we haven't sent 20 I'm going to get rid we haven't sent 20 I'm going to get rid we haven't sent 20 I'm going to get rid of this so you can kind of just see this of this so you can kind of just see this of this so you can kind of just see this other style here so we're going to say other style here so we're going to say other style here so we're going to say of those uh we're going to do this list of those uh we're going to do this list of those uh we're going to do this list and then I'm going to bring this back a and then I'm going to bring this back a and then I'm going to bring this back a little bit here so you can kind of little bit here so you can kind of little bit here so you can kind of see let's change the structure of this a see let's change the structure of this a see let's change the structure of this a little bit so we'll say client uh little bit so we'll say client uh little bit so we'll say client uh messages and then we're going to do a messages and then we're going to do a messages and then we're going to do a list on those now the way that the way list on those now the way that the way list on those now the way that the way that this works is um this is that this works is um this is that this works is um this is asynchronous so JavaScript is asynchronous and if JavaScript is new to asynchronous and if JavaScript is new to asynchronous and if JavaScript is new to you you probably haven't encountered Its asynchronous Behavior what we're going to go over here might very well be to go over here might very well be to go over here might very well be overwhelming but it'll make sense someday if you stick with it I promise someday if you stick with it I promise someday if you stick with it I promise now I've added notes but but really now I've added notes but but really now I've added notes but but really please please please please do not let please please please please do not let please please please please do not let this stress you out I just want this to this stress you out I just want this to this stress you out I just want this to go over your mind about what's happening go over your mind about what's happening go over your mind about what's happening here and it's important to understand because our client here this these list because our client here this these list because our client here this these list methods are asynchronous that which means that it's going to go and run off means that it's going to go and run off means that it's going to go and run off and do some things and then it's going and do some things and then it's going and do some things and then it's going to come back when that comes back it's to come back when that comes back it's to come back when that comes back it's going to uh run this code so this is how going to uh run this code so this is how going to uh run this code so this is how a promise works so it's it's going to a promise works so it's it's going to a promise works so it's it's going to say then after go and make that request say then after go and make that request say then after go and make that request then give me the messages and just so then give me the messages and just so then give me the messages and just so you what's what's kind of strange about you what's what's kind of strange about you what's what's kind of strange about that is if you're you're probably used that is if you're you're probably used that is if you're you're probably used to code uh working like this so I'm to code uh working like this so I'm to code uh working like this so I'm going to write out to the screen that's going to write out to the screen that's going to write out to the screen that's this console log I'm going to say this console log I'm going to say this console log I'm going to say starting starting program and we should see that line print now you might think see that line print now you might think see that line print now you might think that this is going to print um it's that this is going to print um it's that this is going to print um it's going to run this and then go but if you going to run this and then go but if you going to run this and then go but if you you I'll show you here if I do this you I'll show you here if I do this you I'll show you here if I do this console log and I say uh Gathering uh console log and I say uh Gathering uh console log and I say uh Gathering uh message log um what what you'll see is it's going to um what what you'll see is it's going to um what what you'll see is it's going to say this this Line's going to start but say this this Line's going to start but say this this Line's going to start but immediately it's going to go to the next immediately it's going to go to the next immediately it's going to go to the next line so let's do that let's run that one line so let's do that let's run that one line so let's do that let's run that one more time I didn't save it so of course it time I didn't save it so of course it time I didn't save it so of course it won't do anything so you can see this won't do anything so you can see this won't do anything so you can see this little dot here in Visual Studio it little dot here in Visual Studio it little dot here in Visual Studio it didn't save so I'm going to save that didn't save so I'm going to save that didn't save so I'm going to save that run that one more time here we go and run that one more time here we go and run that one more time here we go and you'll see right away it says starting you'll see right away it says starting you'll see right away it says starting program Gathering message log so it it program Gathering message log so it it program Gathering message log so it it ran this but then it went down to here ran this but then it went down to here ran this but then it went down to here so it did not wait because this is so it did not wait because this is so it did not wait because this is asynchronous what's Happening Here is asynchronous and what's happening is client message list returns a promise now it's a list returns a promise now it's a list returns a promise now it's a promise that in the future there will be promise that in the future there will be promise that in the future there will be a value and that value is messages and a value and that value is messages and a value and that value is messages and so the way that you write that code is so the way that you write that code is so the way that you write that code is this then waights it it defines a this then waights it it defines a this then waights it it defines a function here and as soon as this is function here and as soon as this is function here and as soon as this is done it will run this function as soon done it will run this function as soon done it will run this function as soon as they come back it will run the as they come back it will run the as they come back it will run the function so that's what happened right so it came it started it then ran the so it came it started it then ran the so it came it started it then ran the function and when I say function you function and when I say function you function and when I say function you might not have seen before but in might not have seen before but in might not have seen before but in JavaScript you can uh make a function uh JavaScript you can uh make a function uh JavaScript you can uh make a function uh I'm going to put parentheses here so I'm going to put parentheses here so I'm going to put parentheses here so it's a little bit more clear these are it's a little bit more clear these are it's a little bit more clear these are the parameters for the function and this the parameters for the function and this the parameters for the function and this fat arrow is saying this is what happens fat arrow is saying this is what happens fat arrow is saying this is what happens when the function runs this like little when the function runs this like little when the function runs this like little they call it the fat Arrow it's kind of they call it the fat Arrow it's kind of they call it the fat Arrow it's kind of cute right so it's an equal sign and cute right so it's an equal sign and cute right so it's an equal sign and then a greater than it's a it's called a then a greater than it's a it's called a then a greater than it's a it's called a fat arrow and that's a way of quickly fat arrow and that's a way of quickly fat arrow and that's a way of quickly defining a function and so you can see defining a function and so you can see defining a function and so you can see here um there's another one here that's here um there's another one here that's here um there's another one here that's doing it as well um so it can be a doing it as well um so it can be a doing it as well um so it can be a little bit uh um uh Messy as you're see little bit uh um uh Messy as you're see little bit uh um uh Messy as you're see all these pins that we're looking at all these pins that we're looking at all these pins that we're looking at it's kind of kind of hard to understand it's kind of kind of hard to understand it's kind of kind of hard to understand and read if this is your first time and read if this is your first time and read if this is your first time looking at that I totally feel for looking at that I totally feel for looking at that I totally feel for you and so this messages that comes you and so this messages that comes you and so this messages that comes through here is an array so so what was through here is an array so so what was through here is an array so so what was very nice is it came across this very nice is it came across this very nice is it came across this messages list this is an array it was a messages list this is an array it was a messages list this is an array it was a a JavaScript array by itself they have a JavaScript array by itself they have a JavaScript array by itself they have this method called for each on it and it this method called for each on it and it this method called for each on it and it will let you Loop through each of the will let you Loop through each of the will let you Loop through each of the values that are in an array um and values that are in an array um and values that are in an array um and you'll notice that the object that was you'll notice that the object that was you'll notice that the object that was inside of that array has some properties inside of that array has some properties inside of that array has some properties so what happened was the client went and so what happened was the client went and so what happened was the client went and made the request made the HTTP request made the request made the HTTP request made the request made the HTTP request it got back that Json that we saw let me it got back that Json that we saw let me it got back that Json that we saw let me let me just go show you one more time uh let me just go show you one more time uh let me just go show you one more time uh let's make sure that we're looking at let's make sure that we're looking at let's make sure that we're looking at the right thing here so so we we we we the right thing here so so we we we we the right thing here so so we we we we this is the same code that we just saw this is the same code that we just saw this is the same code that we just saw this Json was returned right this Json was returned right this Json was returned right this Json was returned but what the client did for was returned but what the client did for was returned but what the client did for us was it inflated these into messages us was it inflated these into messages us was it inflated these into messages right so these are this is this this is right so these are this is this this is right so these are this is this this is a string of things and it came back Json a string of things and it came back Json a string of things and it came back Json on but I'm able to actually work with on but I'm able to actually work with on but I'm able to actually work with each of these messages as if they're an each of these messages as if they're an each of these messages as if they're an object so let's look look at that again object so let's look look at that again object so let's look look at that again so uh list returned this object this so uh list returned this object this so uh list returned this object this array of messages and each one of those array of messages and each one of those array of messages and each one of those um in that array I'm able to use an um in that array I'm able to use an um in that array I'm able to use an array method for each and this message array method for each and this message array method for each and this message is an actual object that has a property is an actual object that has a property is an actual object that has a property called Sid um so again if that is all called Sid um so again if that is all called Sid um so again if that is all new JavaScript terms to you don't don't new JavaScript terms to you don't don't new JavaScript terms to you don't don't worry too much about it basically we WI worry too much about it basically we WI worry too much about it basically we WI got the messages and we showed the got the messages and we showed the got the messages and we showed the messages that we got that's what this is messages that we got that's what this is messages that we got that's what this is saying one of the things that I want you saying one of the things that I want you saying one of the things that I want you to be careful of as you're looking at to be careful of as you're looking at to be careful of as you're looking at promises and you might see this sometimes as you work with apis because sometimes as you work with apis because sometimes as you work with apis because often times apis that you hit are going often times apis that you hit are going often times apis that you hit are going to be asynchronous like this you might to be asynchronous like this you might to be asynchronous like this you might see that uh you need to be able to you see that uh you need to be able to you see that uh you need to be able to you might run into an error and what's what might run into an error and what's what might run into an error and what's what might happen is it might get swallowed might happen is it might get swallowed might happen is it might get swallowed in fact let me cause one to happen so I in fact let me cause one to happen so I in fact let me cause one to happen so I here it's supposed to say off token I'm here it's supposed to say off token I'm here it's supposed to say off token I'm just going to put in uh um my luggage just going to put in uh um my luggage just going to put in uh um my luggage the password to my luggage 1 2 3 4 5 six the password to my luggage 1 2 3 4 5 six the password to my luggage 1 2 3 4 5 six so that is not my account Sid um that is so that is not my account Sid um that is so that is not my account Sid um that is going in there so I have the wrong going in there so I have the wrong going in there so I have the wrong account Sid so I'm gonna say that hey account Sid so I'm gonna say that hey account Sid so I'm gonna say that hey this is the client this is what how I this is the client this is what how I this is the client this is what how I want you to authenticate and it's going want you to authenticate and it's going want you to authenticate and it's going to go to try to make this and it's going to go to try to make this and it's going to go to try to make this and it's going to fail let's see what happens when it fails well I didn't save it so let's fails well I didn't save it so let's save it again boy that's a lesson that I save it again boy that's a lesson that I save it again boy that's a lesson that I really hit in home you got to make sure really hit in home you got to make sure really hit in home you got to make sure you save your file or the code doesn't you save your file or the code doesn't you save your file or the code doesn't run so let's do it again um and you'll run so let's do it again um and you'll run so let's do it again um and you'll notice that I didn't get any error at notice that I didn't get any error at notice that I didn't get any error at all and that can be confusing that that all and that can be confusing that that all and that can be confusing that that is something that is very strange because obviously something wrong happened I didn't get any of the happened I didn't get any of the happened I didn't get any of the messages back but it doesn't look like I messages back but it doesn't look like I messages back but it doesn't look like I I had any problem so what's happening I had any problem so what's happening I had any problem so what's happening because this is running asynchronously this then never runs right we never get this then never runs right we never get this then never runs right we never get a chance to run this because this list a chance to run this because this list a chance to run this because this list method method didn't actually uh finish working so one of the things you always working so one of the things you always working so one of the things you always want to make sure that you do is to want to make sure that you do is to want to make sure that you do is to every promise you can catch and you can every promise you can catch and you can every promise you can catch and you can catch an error and I'm going to make a catch an error and I'm going to make a catch an error and I'm going to make a fat Arrow cuz I'm I'm going to have a fat Arrow cuz I'm I'm going to have a fat Arrow cuz I'm I'm going to have a function happen here that

happens ah now we see the error and what happens ah now we see the error and you'll see that sometimes uh this is uh you'll see that sometimes uh this is uh you'll see that sometimes uh this is uh what comes back is there was an what comes back is there was an what comes back is there was an authentication error right and we got a authentication error right and we got a authentication error right and we got a very specific error on this 2003 and uh very specific error on this 2003 and uh very specific error on this 2003 and uh it will help us kind of look at what's it will help us kind of look at what's it will help us kind of look at what's happening oh here great this is right my happening oh here great this is right my happening oh here great this is right my off token is wrong the wrong combination off token is wrong the wrong combination off token is wrong the wrong combination of accounts sit in off token exactly of accounts sit in off token exactly of accounts sit in off token exactly that is what has happened um so cool use that is what has happened um so cool use that is what has happened um so cool use of uh things there I'm going to put this of uh things there I'm going to put this of uh things there I'm going to put this back so that we have uh things back so that we have uh things back so that we have uh things working uh so this was off the token and working uh so this was off the token and working uh so this was off the token and I can still leave my error in there I'm I can still leave my error in there I'm I can still leave my error in there I'm not going to hit an error so it's not going to hit an error so it's not going to hit an error so it's not going to happen so a promise has a then going to happen so a promise has a then going to happen so a promise has a then and also has a catch right so uh let's and also has a catch right so uh let's and also has a catch right so uh let's do that so I'm GNA run that one more do that so I'm GNA run that one more do that so I'm GNA run that one more time and save it wow y'all I got to get time and save it wow y'all I got to get time and save it wow y'all I got to get better at saving here we go there we go better at saving here we go there we go better at saving here we go there we go so now we're back to working again so now we're back to working again so now we're back to working again awesome all right I want to show you a awesome all right I want to show you a awesome all right I want to show you a little bit of a different way that little bit of a different way that little bit of a different way that JavaScript can work uh asynchronously that you might also see um and this is that you might also see um and this is that you might also see um and this is really syntactical sugar it's called async await and if you just uh wait a async await and if you just uh wait a async await and if you just uh wait a bit it will all sync in I promise that's bit it will all sync in I promise that's bit it will all sync in I promise that's a there was three jokes in that one that a there was three jokes in that one that a there was three jokes in that one that was a that was a hat trick of a joke all was a that was a hat trick of a joke all was a that was a hat trick of a joke all right so here we go so um the way that right so here we go so um the way that right so here we go so um the way that it works the way that this works is you it works the way that this works is you it works the way that this works is you can say that a a function is going to be can say that a a function is going to be can say that a a function is going to be asynchronous and we want this to run um asynchronous and we want this to run um asynchronous and we want this to run um uh asynchronously so I was thinking we're getting ready to start using our we're getting ready to start using our we're getting ready to start using our number in an application and to get number in an application and to get number in an application and to get there we need to clean it up we have a there we need to clean it up we have a there we need to clean it up we have a bunch of weird messages in there that bunch of weird messages in there that bunch of weird messages in there that aren't going to be relevant to the aren't going to be relevant to the aren't going to be relevant to the messages that we have so I'm going to messages that we have so I'm going to messages that we have so I'm going to make a a new function and I'm going to make a a new function and I'm going to make a a new function and I'm going to call it uh Delete all messages okay and call it uh Delete all messages okay and call it uh Delete all messages okay and when you define a function you can kind when you define a function you can kind when you define a function you can kind of put uh the this is the parameters of put uh the this is the parameters of put uh the this is the parameters that it takes we're going to say that it takes we're going to say that it takes we're going to say that there are no parameters and then I'm there are no parameters and then I'm there are no parameters and then I'm going to run this function so um while this is an a function so um while this is an a function so um while this is an a synchronous function I can actually make it look more uh like it is in line so it look more uh like it is in line so it look more uh like it is in line so it can kind of run the way that we want it can kind of run the way that we want it can kind of run the way that we want it to so I'm going to say const messages to so I'm going to say const messages to so I'm going to say const messages equals a wait so now I have because the equals a wait so now I have because the equals a wait so now I have because the function itself is asynchronous because I've used this here I can use this I've used this here I can use this I've used this here I can use this keyword a08 and I'm going to say keyword a08 and I'm going to say keyword a08 and I'm going to say client dot uh messages.,"['error', 'okay', 'going', 'error', 'okay', 'going', 'error', 'okay', 'going', 'print', 'going', 'print', 'print', 'going',

through but it's also kind of you go through but it's also kind of you go through but it's also kind of similar and so that's really nice about similar and so that's really nice about similar and so that's really nice about the standardness of a rest API is that the standardness of a rest API is that the standardness of a rest API is that the helper library is producing code that feels the same uh in each way that feels the same uh in each way that feels the same uh in each way because the library is kind of the same because the library is kind of the same because the library is kind of the

you need to be able to read this I want you to just read this I want you to just read this I want you to just conceptually understand that you're using a helper Library that's abstracting away all of the HTTP a API abstracting away all of the HTTP a API abstracting away all of the HTTP a API thing things that we were doing with thing things that we were doing with thing things that we were doing with curl and we were doing with rest Fox curl and we were doing with rest Fox curl and we were doing with rest Fox this is just doing it in code and it's this is just doing it in code and it's this is just doing it in code and it's doing it for you a lot of the magic is doing it for you a lot of the magic is doing it for you a lot of the magic is gone uh and hidden and tucked away and gone uh and hidden and tucked away and gone uh and hidden and tucked away and it just feels like you're actually working with these objects that's the power of the abstraction awesome did you power of the abstraction awesome did you power of the abstraction awesome did you see how the helper libraries are all see how the helper libraries are all see how the helper libraries are all similar yet match the development workflow and style of each language this workflow and style of each language this workflow and style of each language this is one of the benefits of helper is one of the benefits of helper is one of the benefits of helper libraries in general they abstract away the HTTP client connection and the boiler plate necessary to make rest API boiler plate necessary to make rest API boiler plate necessary to make rest API calls they also behave as you expect calls they also behave as you expect calls they also behave as you expect them to behave it feels natural the way them to behave it feels natural the way them to behave it feels natural the way that we were able to delete from the that we were able to delete from the that we were able to delete from the resource itself helps to unlock another rest API constraint scavenger hunt item and that one is uniform design now this and that one is uniform design now this and that one is uniform design now this constraint has four subsections one of which we just discussed resource manipulation through representations because enough information was included in the response it was clear for us how in the response it was clear for us how in the response it was clear for us how we could modify and delete the resource we could modify and delete the resource we could modify and delete the resource another subsection in here is resource identification and requests that's the uis that are included and we've seen uis that are included and we've seen uis that are included and we've seen that but because the uis are included we that but because the uis are included we that but because the uis are included we know how to get and manipulate specific know how to get and manipulate specific know how to get and manipulate specific resources uniform use of the HTTP verbs resources uniform use of the HTTP verbs resources uniform use of the HTTP verbs is pretty powerful we just wrote some is pretty powerful we just wrote some is pretty powerful we just wrote some scripts that make use of helper libraries these libraries are super handy for automation based tasks or batch scripting which is like making a batch scripting which is like making a batch scripting which is like making a whole bunch of calls at once now while whole bunch of calls at once now while whole bunch of calls at once now while we're talking about this we should cover we're talking about this we should cover we're talking about this we should cover another common tool for talking to external apis and that one is CLI external apis and that one is CLI external apis and that one is CLI command line interface there it is again command line interface there it is again command line interface there it is again command line interfaces can be used to command line interfaces can be used to command line interfaces can be used to make API calls from an executable on make API calls from an executable on make API calls from an executable on your machine more and more these are your machine more and more these are your machine more and more these are showing up for tools that require authentication and do a bunch of different services this concept is popular amongst Cloud providers where setting something up needs to be done setting something up needs to be done setting something up needs to be done quickly from the command line check the quickly from the command line check the quickly from the command line check the notes for more another common place where you'll use helper libraries is from within applications that you're building building let's get to the final building building let's get to the final building building let's get to the final unit of this course and Implement an unit of this course and Implement an unit of this course and Implement an external API into an existing web application you've got this o we're here application you've got this o we're here application you've got this o we're here I love this part the building part we're I love this part the building part we're I love this part the building part we're going to build a web application that going to build a web application that going to build a web application that shows off a set of User submitted photos shows off a set of User submitted photos shows off a set of User submitted photos for a specific prompt but here's where for a specific prompt but here's where for a specific prompt but here's where our app is going to stick out from all our app is going to stick out from all our app is going to stick out from all the rest we're going to let our users the rest we're going to let our users the rest we're going to let our users submit their photos and captions via a submit their photos and captions via a submit their photos and captions via a text message what this will enable us to text message what this will enable us to text message what this will enable us to do is put up signs and billboards in do is put up signs and billboards in do is put up signs and billboards in physical spaces that says text a photo physical spaces that says text a photo physical spaces that says text a photo to this number and then our site will to this number and then our site will to this number and then our site will gather those on a web page and display gather those on a web page and display gather those on a web page and display them now you're probably wondering two things right now the first one is things right now the first one is things right now the first one is probably wait what are those photos they're going to be texting and that's a they're going to be texting and that's a they're going to be texting and that's a great question we're going to be building this application so it can be building this application so it can be building this application so it can be dynamic so you can Define whatever you dynamic so you can Define whatever you dynamic so you can Define whatever you want like text me a photo of your dog want like text me a photo of your dog want like text me a photo of your dog send us a photo of the view out your send us a photo of the view out your send us a photo of the view out your window snap me a pick of the best window snap me a pick of the best window snap me a pick of the best impersonation of me I I don't know impersonation of me I I don't know impersonation of me I I don't know anything along those lines now secondly you're probably wondering wait a second you said I didn't need to know how to you said I didn't need to know how to you said I didn't need to know how to code if you already know how to make a code if you already know how to make a code if you already know how to make a website this part might not have faced website this part might not have faced website this part might not have faced you but if building a website is outside you but if building a website is outside you but if building a website is outside of your Learning Journey thus far no of your Learning Journey thus far no of your Learning Journey thus far no sweat I've got it set up and we're going sweat I've got it set up and we're going sweat I've got it set up and we're going to take our time we're going to focus on to take our time we're going to focus on to take our time we're going to focus on making things work using this API all making things work using this API all making things work using this API all right let's do this okay so I have a right let's do this okay so I have a right let's do this okay so I have a template here in the notes uh in the uh template here in the notes uh in the uh template here in the notes uh in the uh unit 3 video one we have this unit 3 video one we have this unit 3 video one we have this index.html which is our web application um if you come in here you can scroll um if you come in here you can scroll um if you come in here you can scroll you can kind of see things here we've you can kind of see things here we've you can kind of see things here we've we've the app is called pickle where you we've the app is called pickle where you we've the app is called pickle where you get to pick your picks Peter pick the get to pick your picks Peter pick the get to pick your picks Peter pick the pickle pickle that sort of fun joke pickle pickle that sort of fun joke pickle pickle that sort of fun joke there and then we're going to click this there and then we're going to click this there and then we're going to click this RAW button right here we're going to get RAW button right here we're going to get RAW button right here we're going to get a hold of this raw and I am going to uh highlight raw and I am going to uh highlight raw and I am going to uh highlight everything and use the magical uh developer command C copy and then I'm developer command C copy and then I'm developer command C copy and then I'm going to come over to uh back to my going to come over to uh back to my going to come over to uh back to my scratch on my visual studio code I'm scratch on my visual studio code I'm scratch on my visual studio code I'm going to make a new file I'm going to make a new file I'm going to make a new file I'm going to call that index.html hypertext mark language right and I'm going to paste that right here and I'm going to paste that right here and I'm going to paste that right here so now I have that code locally on my so now I have that code locally on my so now I have that code locally on my machine if you are a git user you could machine if you are a git user you could machine if you are a git user you could definitely check this out and have your definitely check this out and have your definitely check this out and have your own uh version of this if you wanted to own uh version of

we're just going to here locally because we're just going to here locally because we're just going to explore around here just for a little explore around here just for a little explore around here just for a little bit let's take a look at this file uh as bit let's take a look at this file uh as bit let's take a look at this file uh as it exists this is something that might it exists this is something that might it exists this is something that might happen to you um as a developer who happen to you um as a developer who happen to you um as a developer who knows now about apis they might say hey knows now about apis they might say hey knows now about apis they might say hey I've got this template um and I would I've got this template um and I would I've got this template um and I would love for you to be able ble to set it up love for you to be able ble to set it up love for you to be able ble to set it up to make the the API work so the first to make the the API work so the first to make the the API work so the first thing to do um if you want to look at an thing to do um if you want to look at an thing to do um if you want to look at an index uh uh file locally on your index uh uh file locally on your index uh uh file locally on your computer you could set up a web server computer you could set up a web server computer you could set up a web server I've made it so we don't need to have a I've made it so we don't need to have a I've made it so we don't need to have a web server um so we can just go ahead web server um so we can just go ahead web server um so we can just go ahead I'm going to go to my terminal I'm going to go to my terminal I'm going to go to my terminal I'm going to um do a new terminal here I'm going to open that up and uh here I'm going to

do um uh in my now what that's going to do um uh in my Mac uh is going to open this up for Mac uh is going to open this up for Mac uh is going to open this up for Windows take a look and see how to do Windows take a look and see how to do Windows take a look and see how to do this exactly but what this will do it this exactly but what this will do it this exactly but what this will do it was will update my uh my pickle here so was will update my uh my pickle here so was will update my uh my pickle here so so you can see this is this user scratch so you can see this is this user scratch so you

much about necessarily need to worry too much about necessarily need to worry too much about this but I wanted to show you um that this but I wanted to show you um that this but I wanted to show you um that there is this is how view works it's a there is this is how view works it's a there is this is how view works it's a front end framework and it provides an front end framework and it provides

get data and whatever is in here will get data and whatever is in here will get returned uh to it and then there's some returned uh to it and then there's some returned uh to it and then there's some more uh I can Define some methods on The more uh I can Define some methods on The more uh I can Define some methods on The View object one of those methods that View object one of those methods that View object one of those methods that I've defined is called load images part I've defined is called load images part I've defined is called load images part of the API that view uh creates is there of the API that view uh creates is there of the API that view uh creates is there is a life cycle method called mounted is a life cycle method called mounted is a life cycle method called mounted which means that when the application is which means that when the application is which means that when the application is ready and it has been mounted onto your ready and it has been mounted onto your ready and it has been mounted onto your HTML through the JavaScript it will call HTML through the JavaScript it will call HTML through the JavaScript it will call this function so it's going to call this function so it's going to call this function so it's going to call this load images function and this load images function you'll notice it's an async uh uh image and I've got some async uh uh image and I've got some async uh uh image and I've got some to-dos in here this is someplace where to-dos in here this is someplace where to-dos in here this is someplace where you might be communicating back and forth with uh people uh as you're forth with uh people uh as you're forth with uh people uh as you're working uh together on a project so use working uh together on a project so use working uh together on a project so use the messaging API to use uh submitted the messaging API to use uh submitted the messaging API to use uh submitted photos and also create a web- based API photos and also create a web- based API photos and also create a web- based API that matches us expected response so that's what we're going to do over the that's what we're going to do over the that's what we're going to do over the next couple videos here uh so what we next couple videos here uh so what we next couple videos here uh so what we see in the start here is there's this see in the start here is there's this see in the start here is there's this gallery and it is an array and it's got gallery and it is an array and it's got gallery and it is an array and it's got um some stuff from this there's a um some stuff from this there's a um some stuff from this there's a website called Place kit that I used website called Place kit that I used website called Place kit that I used here so you can get different versions here so you can get different versions here so you can get different versions of K kitties here and there's a of K kitties here and there's a of K kitties here and there's a description and there's an ALT tag which description and there's an ALT tag which description and there's an ALT tag which is important because uh for for accessibility reasons this is what it will say on the picture so uh will say on the picture so uh will say on the picture so uh that is what is happening to be able to that is what is happening to be able to that is what is happening to be able to make that work um so we we now have our app here work um so we we now have our app here work um so we we now have our app here uh locally and we can change things so uh locally and we can change things so uh locally and we can change things so um one of the things one of the photos um one of the things one of the photos um one of the things one of the photos um that I want to do uh I love to get um that I want to do uh I love to get um that I want to do uh I love to get photos of burritos from around town so photos of burritos from around town so photos of burritos from around town so I'm going to change this I'm going to change this I'm going to change this I'm going to say submit me a photo of your burritos say submit me a photo of your burritos say submit me a photo of your burritos and I'm going to save that file so see and I'm going to save that file so see and I'm going to save that file so see it's not saved I'm going to save it when it's not saved I'm going to save it when it's not saved I'm going to save it when I go back to my file there when I go back to my file there when I go back to my file there when I refresh it you can see that it says refresh it you can see that it says refresh it you can see that it says burrito what are you going to want to gather why what are you going to want to gather why what are you going to want to gather why don't you go ahead and change that uh don't you go ahead and change that uh don't you go ahead and change that uh change that to whatever it is that change that to whatever it is that change that to whatever it is that you're wanted to gather as we build this you're wanted to gather as we build this you're wanted to gather as we build this project through and of course you know project through and of course you know project through and of course you know you see that you can change that however you see that you can change that however you see that you can change that however so make sure that it's downloaded make so make sure that it's downloaded make so make sure that it's downloaded make sure that you can change that that you sure that you can change that that you sure that you can change that that you can change this file and it opens uh can change this file and it opens uh can change this file and it opens uh locally on your machine cool and so now locally on your machine cool and so now locally on your machine cool and so now we have a little smattering of apis here we have a little smattering of apis here we have a little smattering of apis here already so we have a a web we have HTML already so we have a a web we have HTML already so we have a a web we have HTML working here we have this View and this working here we have this View and this working here we have this View and this view API has a very specific API that's view API has a very specific API that's view API has a very specific API that's doing this mounted uh here but remember doing this mounted uh here but remember doing this mounted uh here but remember it is actually an API and we're going to it is actually an API and we're going to it is actually an API and we're going to use a web-based API uh to be able to to use a web-based API uh to be able to to use a web-based API uh to be able to to get this information and we're going to get this information and we're going to get this information and we're going to do that here in just a bit now that we do that here in just a bit now that we do that here in just a bit now that we got our file all working let's deploy it got our file all working let's deploy it got our file all working let's deploy it and by that I mean let's get it up on and by that I mean let's get it up on and by that I mean let's get it up on the public internet so everyone can see the public internet so everyone can see the public internet so everyone can see it that is of course after you take a it that is of course after you take a it that is of course after you take a quick break [Music] we're going to get our web page up on we're going to get our web page up on we're going to get our web page up on the Internet so others can see it and the Internet so others can see it and the Internet so others can see it and this has gotten much easier as time has this has gotten much easier as time has this has gotten much easier as time has progressed you used to have to set up a progressed you used to have to set up a progressed you used to have to set up a server like a physical computer buy a server like a physical computer buy a server like a physical computer buy a domain name and configure it to point to domain name and configure it to point to domain name and configure it to point to your machine you had to figure out where your machine you had to figure out where your machine you had to figure out where to to host like to where to locate your to to host like to where to locate your to to host like to where to locate your server so that it was always on and server so that it was always on and server so that it was always on and arguably the hardest part after it was arguably the hardest part after it was arguably the hardest part after it was live you used to have to watch over it live you used to have to watch over it live you used to have to watch over it in case too many people came to it you in case too many people came to it you in case too many people came to it you didn't want it to get overloaded you didn't want it to get overloaded you didn't want it to get overloaded you wanted it to scale up and be able to wanted it to scale up and be able to wanted it to scale up and be able to handle the traffic those servers are still around but these days you don't still around but these days you don't still around but these days you don't really need to worry about them too much really need to worry about them too much really need to worry about them too much now I'm sure that you've heard the term now I'm sure that you've heard the term now I'm sure that you've heard the term the cloud and the colloquium the cloud and the colloquium the cloud and the colloquium the cloud is just other people's computers well let's talk a bit about serverless serverless is just other people's servers it removes all those previous things that we had to worry about and it things that we had to worry about and it things that we had to worry about and it offloads your concerns I can tell by the look on your concerns I can tell by the look on your concerns I can tell by the look on your face that it's probably better if I just face that it's probably better if I just face that it's probably better if I just show you let's get this application hosted so we're going to have twilio host our so we're going to have twilio host our so we're going to have twilio host our code for us and that is to say we're code for us and that is to say we're code for us and that is to say we're going to have twilio be our web server going to have twilio be our web server going to have twilio be our web server that will be use to serve our HTML our that will be use to serve our HTML our that will be use to serve our HTML our project will be serverless now the way project will be serverless now the way project will be serverless now the way you do that is by using twilio's you do that is by using twilio's you do that is by using twilio's serverless environment which is here under functions and Assets Now if you under functions and Assets Now if you under functions and Assets Now if you don't have that here if you click don't have that here if you click don't have that here if you click explore products and you come to developer tools and you come over to developer tools and you come over to developer tools and you come over to functions and assets you can click this functions and assets you can click this functions and assets you can click this little pin icon and that will make it little pin icon and that will make it little pin icon and that will make it show up here so I am going to create a show up here so I am going to create a show up here so I am going to create a new service so I'm going to go functions new service so I'm going to go functions new service so I'm going to go functions and assets services and I'm going to say and assets services and I'm going to say and assets services and I'm going to say create service it could be whatever you create service it could be whatever you create service it could be whatever you want I'm going to call it pickle like want I'm going to call it pickle like want I'm going to call it pickle like pick your picks with pickle Peter Services allow us to group pickle Peter Services allow us to group pickle Peter Services allow us to group our functions and assets together for our application so I'm going to click our application so I'm going to click our application so I'm going to click next and what's going to happen is we're next and what's going to happen is we're next and what's going to happen is we're going to open up to a very nice IDE that going to open up to a very nice IDE that going to open up to a very nice IDE that will allow us to edit our code now a will allow us to edit our code now a will allow us to edit our code now a friendly reminder if you're having a hard time following along because my screen looks different than yours you are using a new and improved experience are using a new and improved experience are using a new and improved experience so check the notes for what might be so check the notes for what might be so check the notes for what might be different now traditionally these Services here are used to power twilio Services here are used to power twilio Services here are used to power twilio based applications remember how I said you could respond programmatically to an incoming message well functions are a great way to do just that in fact our great way to do just that in fact our great way to do just that in fact our current number has a default response and we might as well fix it while we're and we might as well fix it while we're and we might as well fix it while we're here here but before we do that let's here here but before we do that let's here here but before we do that let's get our HTML code up and running so what get our HTML code up and running so what get our HTML code up and running so what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab I'm going to do is I'm going to grab I'm going to do is I'm going to grab code from my local machine and if you code from my local machine and if you code from my local machine and if you want to you can just grab it for GitHub want to you can just grab it for GitHub want to you can just grab it for GitHub check the notes for more on that but I'm check the notes for more on that but I'm check the notes for more on that but I'm going to go add I'm going to choose going to go add I'm going to choose going to go add I'm going to choose upload file I'm going to find my file my upload file I'm going to find my file my upload file I'm going to find my file my index.html and I'm going to choose open index.html and I'm going to choose open index.html and I'm going to choose open now what we're uploading we'd like the now what we're uploading we'd like the now what we're uploading we'd like the world to be able to see it so I'm going world to be able to see it so I'm going world to be able to see it so I'm going to choose public and then I'm going to choose public and then I'm going to choose public and then I'm going to choose upload so now this files over here upload so now this files over here you'll notice this little Green Dot and you'll notice this little Green Dot and you'll notice this little Green Dot and this means that it is not yet deployed this means that it is not yet deployed this means that it is not yet deployed and that is it's not yet available on and that is it's not yet available on and that is it's not yet available on the internet in this current state so the internet in this current state so the internet in this current state so let's do that I'm going to do that by let's do that I'm going to do that by let's do that I'm going to do that by clicking this deploy all button down here and now we see that it's green and here and now we see that it's green and I'm going to go ahead and choose copy I'm going to go ahead and choose copy I'm going to go ahead and choose copy URL and I'm going to open up a new tab URL and I'm going to open up a new tab URL and I'm going to open up a new tab with that there and we will see that our with that there and we will see that our with that there and we will see that our site is live except it says burritos and site is live except it says burritos and site is live except it says burritos and these are kittens but we're getting there so uh it's working it's up it's on there so uh it's working it's up it's on there so uh it's working it's up it's on the internet I could share this with the internet I could share this with the internet I could share this with people the pickle site is up and running people the pickle site is up and running people the pickle site is up and running on twilio's servers one of the things on twilio's servers one of the things on twilio's servers one of the things that I used to have to worry about was that I used to have to worry about was that I used to have to worry about was scale like what if I got a whole bunch scale like what if I got a whole bunch scale like what if I got a whole bunch of requests to the site would it fall of requests to the site would it fall of requests to the site would it fall over what the serverless solution is doing is allowing me to not need to doing is allowing me to not need to doing is allowing me to not need to worry about any of that anymore twio is worry about any of that anymore twio is worry about any of that anymore twio is handling all those concerns for me which handling all those concerns for me which handling all those concerns for me which is great cuz now I can focus on what I is great cuz now I can focus on what I is great cuz now I can focus on what I was building which by the way we need to was building which by the way we need to was building which by the way we need to handle that reply programmatically right so the way that twilio does things is so the way that twilio does things is so the way that twilio does things is with web hooks now if you haven't with web hooks now if you haven't with web hooks now if you haven't encountered web hooks before I have an encountered web hooks before I have an encountered web hooks before I have an entire course on them that I link to in entire course on them that I link to in entire course on them that I link to in the notes web hooks are sometimes called the notes web hooks are sometimes called the notes web hooks are sometimes called a reverse API that is instead of you a reverse API that is instead of you a reverse API that is instead of you calling the API the API calls you so calling the API the API calls you so calling the API the API calls you so let's configure our number to make use let's configure our number to make use let's configure our number to make use of the right web hook so I'm going to go of the right web hook so I'm going to go of the right web hook so I'm going to go uh back to my number uh over here if I look under phone uh over here if I look under phone uh over here if I look under phone numbers and I do manage I'm going to numbers and I do manage I'm going to numbers and I do manage I'm going to hold down uh command or control and hold down uh command or control and hold down uh command or control and click active numbers I'll open up a new click active numbers I'll open up a new click active numbers I'll open up a new tab nice little hack to keep your screen tab nice little hack to keep your screen tab nice little hack to keep your screen open here uh so I've got my numbers here open here uh so I've got my numbers here open here uh so I've got my numbers here and if I come in here to configure it what happens is I'm going to scroll it what happens is I'm going to scroll down so here's the voice section and down so here's the voice section and down so here's the voice section and then here's the messaging section and it then here's the messaging section and it then here's the messaging section and it says when a message comes in to this web says when a message comes in to this web says when a message comes in to this web hook and it sends to this URL here it does a post to this URL here it does a post to this URL here it does a post to this URL here so the way that twilio makes use of here so the way that twilio makes use of here so the way that twilio makes use of web hooks can be thought of like this web hooks can be thought of like this web hooks can be thought of like this you know when I hit uh this URL right you know when I hit uh this URL right you know when I hit uh this URL right this URL in my browser my browser this URL in my browser my browser this URL in my browser my browser doesn't care about what's happening at that endpoint it could have been anything any web server like Express Django a Java Ser it it doesn't matter Django a Java Ser it it doesn't matter Django a Java Ser it it doesn't matter what matters is that what was returned what matters is that what was returned what matters is that what was returned from my server was HTM or hyper text markup language my server or hyper text markup language my server or hyper text markup language my server responds with HTML and my browser renders the page now the same is true renders the page now the same is true renders the page now the same is true with twio someone is going to text our with twio someone is going to text our with twio someone is going to text our twilio number and twio is going to send twilio number and twio is going to send twilio number and twio is going to send a request to an endpoint in this case a request to an endpoint in this case a request to an endpoint in this case this endpoint here it doesn't matter what is happening on the other side as what is happening on the other side as what is happening on the other side as long as it returns twiml or twillo long as it returns twiml or twillo long as it returns twiml or twillo markup language they look very similar HTML and twiml twilio will be able to your application so we could set up a your application so we could set up a your application so we could set up a new web server to host this application new web server to host this application new web server to host this application that returns twiml or we could just use that returns twiml or we could just use that returns twiml or we could just use a twilio function and like I said a twilio function and like I said a twilio function and like I said earlier that is what these are commonly earlier that is what these are commonly earlier that is what these are commonly used for so let's let's pop back to our used for so let's let's pop back to our used for so let's let's pop back to our service so I'm going to come here I'm service so I'm going to come here I'm service so I'm going to come here I'm going to add a new function and I'm going to add a new function and I'm going to add a new function and I'm going to name this function incoming message that's what we're going to do message that's what we're going to do message that's what we're going to do we're going to handle an incoming message and there is some very nice message and there is some very nice default boiler plate that is commented that comes through so boilerplate is code that's provided that's usually the most common thing that you're going to most common thing that you're going to most common thing that you're going to be doing and in this case it is it's be doing and in this case it is it's be doing and in this case it is it's boiler plate for how to respond to an boiler plate for how to respond to an boiler plate for how to respond to an incoming phone call it's kind of like incoming phone call it's kind of like incoming phone call it's kind of like the hello world of uh voice applications the hello world of uh voice applications the hello world of uh voice applications but we're going to be building a but we're going to be building a but we're going to be building a messaging application so we'll need to tweak this just a bit now I've put this tweak this just a bit now I've put this tweak this just a bit now I've put this code I'm about to show you into the code I'm about to show you into the code I'm about to show you into the notes so I don't want you to feel like notes so I don't want you to feel like notes so I don't want you to feel like you have to type this all out or even you have to type this all out or even you have to type this all out or even fully understand every line I will step fully understand every line I will step fully understand every line I will step you through it first though let me walk you through it first though let me walk you through it first though let me walk you through this function just a bit so you through this function just a bit so you through this function just a bit so twio functions all export a a thing twio functions all export a a thing twio functions all export a a thing called a Handler and that Handler takes called a Handler and that Handler takes called a Handler and that Handler takes a function that takes some parameters context event and call back context here is an object that back context here is an object that back context here is an object that holds information about the function that's running like it knows the domain that's running like it knows the domain that's running like it knows the domain it knows the name of the function and it knows the name of the function and it knows the name of the function and the event here you can kind of think of the event here you can kind of think of the event here you can kind of think of this like a web request in in most this like a web request in in most this like a web request in in most Frameworks and if you haven't seen a Frameworks and if you haven't seen a Frameworks and if you haven't seen a framework before this is kind of the way framework before this is kind of the way framework before this is kind of the way that information is passed into your web that information is passed into your web that information is passed into your web application uh so so this is the event application uh so so this is the event application uh so so this is the event will hold everything about the text message that was incoming because that's what twilio does twilio is going to pass what twilio does twilio is going to pass what twilio does twilio is going to pass that information through here and for instance that message will have the two instance that message will have the two instance that message will have the two it'll have from and body and again it'll have from and body and again it'll have from and body and again because when the text message comes in because when the text message comes in because when the text message comes in we are going to point our phone number we are going to point our phone number we are going to point our phone number to this function so twilio will post the to this function so twilio will post the to this function so twilio will post the information here it will call our function instead of us writing code that function instead of us writing code that function instead of us writing code that checks if a new message was added over checks if a new message was added over checks if a new message was added over and over again twilio is going to call and over again twilio is going to call and over again twilio is going to call us the API is going to call us via a web us the API is going to call us via a web us the API is going to call us via a web hook web hooks are pretty cool uh check hook web hooks are pretty cool uh check hook web hooks are pretty cool uh check the notes and then finally there's this the notes and then finally there's this the notes and then finally there's this call back uh object here which is how we call back uh object here which is how we call back uh object here which is how we send information out of the function it's actually a function so we have this it's actually a function so we have this it's actually a function so we have this call back uh this is the errors that call back uh this is the errors that call back uh this is the errors that might have happen and then this is what might have happen and then this is what might have happen and then this is what gets returned and here's that twiml twillo markup language so I'm going to twillo markup language so I'm going to twillo markup language so I'm going to get rid of a couple of these lines here get rid of a couple of these lines here get rid of a couple of these lines here these are sort of demo lines I'm going these are sort of demo lines I'm going these are sort of demo lines I'm going to get rid of that and I want you to be to get rid of that and I want you to be to get rid of that and I want you to be able to see what's coming into the able to see what's coming into the able to see what's coming into the message so I'm going to start up here message so I'm going to start up here message so I'm going to start up here I'm going to do a console.log and what what this does is console.log and what what this does is console.log and what what this does is when the function runs uh if we want to when the function runs uh if we want to when the function runs uh if we want to we can see the message it will show up we can see the message it will show up we can see the message it will show up down here so uh let's say that we got an down here so uh let's say that we got an down here so uh let's say that we got an incoming message and uh it was incoming message and we'll just do a was incoming message and we'll just do a was incoming message and we'll just do a call in and then I'm going to use this call in and then I'm going to use this call in and then I'm going to use this dollar this St of string interpolation so I have the event object and on it so I have the event object and on it so I have the event object and on it there is a property called body with a there is a property called body with a there is a property called body with a capital B so that's being passed in capital B so that's being passed in capital B so that's being passed in there so uh when the function runs we there so uh when the function runs we there so uh when the function runs we will see that the message came in will see that the message came in will see that the message came in because twio is going to pass that because twio is going to pass that because twio is going to pass that message and we'll see it there and we're message and we'll see it there and we're message and we'll see it there and we're just going to say thanks when somebody just going to say thanks when somebody just going to say thanks when somebody sends Us in so we don't really need to sends Us in so we don't really need to sends Us in so we don't really need to do anything with this message but you do anything with this message but you do anything with this message but you might want to filter it or handle things might want to filter it or handle things might want to filter it or handle things differently based on what they said in differently based on what they said in differently based on what they said in the message and and you totally could do the message and and you totally could do the message and and you totally could do that but you'd probably also want to that but you'd probably also want to that but you'd probably also want to check the photo that came in in was check the photo that came in in was check the photo that came in in was actually a burrito or something not in actually a burrito or something not in actually a burrito or something not in AES you could do that and there are apis AES you could do that and there are apis AES you could do that and there are apis for that but that's a little out of for that but that's a little out of for that but that's a little out of scope so instead of a voice response scope so instead of a voice response scope so instead of a voice response we're actually going to return uh a we're actually going to return uh a we're actually going to return uh a messaging response and there's a little helper Library here right so a little helper Library here right so a little helper Library here right so a little helper library for twiml uh and it has helper library for twiml uh and it has helper library for twiml uh and it has this twiml object and uh before it was doing say object and uh before it was doing say object and uh before it was doing say which is text to speech so if you you which is text to speech so if you you which is text to speech so if you you wired this up it would say hello world wired this up it would say hello world wired this up it would say hello world in like a computery but actually pretty in like a computery but actually pretty in like a computery but actually pretty good sounding voice the days but I'm good sounding voice the days but I'm good sounding voice the days but I'm going to change this to be a message cuz going to change this to be a message cuz going to change this to be a message cuz that's what we want to return we want to that's what we want to return we want to that's what we want to return we want to return a message and we want to say uh return a message and we want to say uh return a message and we want to say uh thanks for your submission right we want to want to your submission right we want to want to your submission right we want to want to thank them there we can also send any thank them there we can also send any thank them there we can also send any sort of emoji here let's see if maybe a sort of emoji here let's see if maybe a sort of emoji here let's see if maybe a camera that sounds yeah that's nice thanks for your submission and so what's thanks for your submission and so what's thanks for your submission and so what's happening here is this object it's a happening here is this object it's a happening here is this object it's a fluid API it uh means that it doesn't fluid API it uh means that it doesn't fluid API it uh means that it doesn't return anything you kind of tweak it and return anything you kind of tweak it and return anything you kind of tweak it and and it builds as things go uh on it so and it builds as things go uh on it so and it builds as things go uh on it so you'll notice that this isn't returning anything I'm modifying this object and then uh when I send it out at the end then uh when I send it out at the end then uh when I send it out at the end that's how how it goes out so let me that's how how it goes out so let me that's how how it goes out so let me let's just let me show you what that let's just let me show you what that let's just let me show you what that object looks like so again I'll do one object looks like so again I'll do one object looks like so again I'll do one of these con console.log and use the back tick and console.log and use the back tick and console.log and use the back tick and we'll say twiml so twilio markup language was uh Twi and you'll see that language was uh Twi and you'll see that language was uh Twi and you'll see that it looks a lot like HTML uh there are it looks a lot like HTML uh there are it looks a lot like HTML uh there are some rules to it but we don't need to some rules to it but we don't need to some rules to it but we don't need to learn them all right now so I'm going to learn them all right now so I'm going to learn them all right now so I'm going to save this and uh just like before you'll save this and uh just like before you'll save this and uh just like before you'll notice that this is gray it hasn't been notice that this is gray it hasn't been notice that this is gray it hasn't been deployed so I'm going to click deploy deployed so I'm going to click deploy deployed so I'm going to click deploy all and while that's building I'm going all and while that's building I'm going all and while that's building I'm going to head back to my phone number page and to head back to my phone number page and to head back to my phone number page and I'm going to refresh it so on my phone I'm going to refresh it so on my phone I'm going to refresh it so on my phone number page I need to change my message number page I need to change my message number page I need to change my message down here it says when a when a message down here it says when a when a message down here it says when a when a message comes in we want it to be a function comes in we want it to be a function comes in we want it to be a function that is in the pickle service that's uh that is in the pickle service that's uh that is in the pickle service that's uh done in the UI and we want to choose done in the UI and we want to choose done in the UI and we want to choose incoming message which it hasn't finished deploying yet just finished deploying one more time time Let me deploying one more time time Let me deploying one more time time Let me refresh that page so that shows up for refresh that page so that shows up for refresh that page so that shows up for us uh we're going to go to uh when a us uh we're going to go to uh when a us uh we're going to go to uh when a message comes in it's going to be a message comes in it's going to be a message comes in it's going to be a function and it's on the pickle service function and it's on the pickle service function and it's on the pickle service for this UI and we want to do incoming for this UI and we want to do incoming for this UI and we want to do incoming message and if we do save all right so message and if we do save all right so message and if we do save all right so we should be all wired up I'm going to we should be all wired up I'm going to we should be all wired up I'm going to click uh clear logs here and I'm going click uh clear logs here and I'm going click uh clear logs here and I'm going to turn uh live logs on you can see that to turn uh live logs on you can see that to turn uh live logs on you can see that this says live logs on when it's ready this says live logs on when it's ready this says live logs on when it's ready I'm going to clear the logs one more I'm going to clear the logs one more I'm going to clear the logs one more time and what I'm going to do now is I'm time and what I'm going to do now is I'm time and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to send a message in and we should going to send a message in and we should going to send a message in and we should see this we should see what what I send see this we should see what what I send see this we should see what what I send in and uh we should see the twiml that in and uh we should see the twiml that in and uh we should see the twiml that was sent back and I should get a was sent back and I should get a was sent back and I should get a response back so let me let me send that response back so let me let me send that response back so let me let me send that message here let me send this text all message here let me send this text all message here let me send this text all right so oh check out this I have this right so oh check out this I have this right so oh check out this I have this beautiful picture of a burrito I love beautiful picture of a burrito I love beautiful picture of a burrito I love when burritos can stand up by themselves when burritos can stand up by themselves when burritos can stand up by themselves and this is an awesome one I'm going to and this is an awesome one I'm going to and this is an awesome one I'm going to send this in so check out this beautiful send this in so check out this beautiful send this in so check out this beautiful burrito little Emoji I'm going to send burrito little Emoji I'm going to send burrito little Emoji I'm going to send that through and we should see here in that through and we should see here in that through and we should see here in the live logs we should see the message the live logs we should see the message the live logs we should see the message come through there we go so look at this come through there we go so look at this come through there we go so look at this beautiful burrito um and this is the beautiful burrito um and this is the beautiful burrito um and this is the twiml that was generated so you can see twiml that was generated so you can see twiml that was generated so you can see it's like tag based so there's a it's like tag based so there's a it's like tag based so there's a response and there's a closing response and there's an opening message and a and there's an opening message and a and there's an opening message and a closing message thanks for your submission I don't want you to feel like submission I don't want you to feel like submission I don't want you to feel like you need to learn twiml uh you can do you need to learn twiml uh you can do you need to learn twiml uh you can do that later uh if you need to uh but but that later uh if you need to uh but but that later uh if you need to uh but but this uh works so I got my message back this uh works so I got my message back this uh works so I got my message back now remember since we are in trial mode now remember since we are in trial mode now remember since we are in trial mode if somebody else sends in a message to if somebody else sends in a message to if somebody else sends in a message to your phone number they're only going to your phone number they're only going to your phone number they're only going to get a message back if they're a verified get a message back if they're a verified get a message back if they're a verified sender so that is a limit of the trial sender so that is a limit of the trial sender so that is a limit of the trial API that we're using currently now most API that we're using currently now most API that we're using currently now most apis have limits there's only so many apis have limits there's only so many apis have limits there's only so many calls you can make there's you can only calls you can make there's you can only calls you can make there's you can only send to verified numbers there's just different sort of limits and that's what different sort of limits and that's what different sort of limits and that's what we're working with here right now the we're working with here right now the we're working with here right now the limit is that you can only send to limit is that you can only send to limit is that you can only send to verified numbers uh they can still submit they just won't get this thanks submit they just won't get this thanks submit they just won't get this thanks for your submission so your phone number for your submission so your phone number for your submission so your phone number should so when you submit from your should so when you submit from your should so when you submit from your phone number you should get it just like phone number you should get it just like phone number you should get it just like I did all right so we're looking good we I did all right so we're looking good we I did all right so we're looking good we have our site hosted and we're handling some missions by thanking them let's get to some more thanking them let's get to some more thanking them let's get to some more cooking now if you're interested in learning more about applications like this over the phone check out the notes this over the phone check out the notes this over the phone check out the notes for more resources I have an entire for more resources I have an entire for more resources I have an entire course on this if this pequ your course on this if this pequ your course on this if this pequ your interest but for now let's get back to interest but for now let's get back to interest but for now let's get back to our API now with our ability to host our API now with our ability to host our API now with our ability to host our own application we can focus on designing our own API now the great news designing our own API now the great news designing our own API now the great news is that twilio functions makes it really is that twilio functions makes it really is that twilio functions makes it really straightforward to return Json remember that's JavaScript object notation the lingua Fran of the web let's design our lingua Fran of the web let's design our lingua Fran of the web let's design our web-based API to return the expected format and we can make use of twilio's format and we can make use of twilio's format and we can make use of twilio's message Api to get a hold of all the message Api to get a hold of all the message Api to get a hold of all the messages that we received do you see messages that we received do you see messages that we received do you see what I did there get get get it all what I did there get get get it all what I did there get get get it all right I'm I'm gon get out of here I right I'm I'm gon get out of here I right I'm I'm gon get out of here I can't stop all right let's do this okay can't stop all right let's do this okay can't stop all right let's do this okay so we're gonna actually write an API and so we're gonna actually write an API and so we're gonna actually write an API and we already have a spec or a we already have a spec or a we already have a spec or a specification right we need to provide for this specific plugin this silent box for this specific plugin this silent box for this specific plugin this silent box has this Gallery plugin and it has a has this Gallery plugin and it has a has this Gallery plugin and it has a specific API that it defines and that specific API that it defines and that specific API that it defines and that API looks like this right so remember API looks like this right so remember API looks like this right so remember we're setting this gallery and we're setting an array we're setting this information here so I think we should information here so I think we should information here so I think we should start by creating an endpoint that returns exactly what we have here we returns exactly what we have here we returns exactly what we have here we should return an endpoint that does this should return an endpoint that does this should return an endpoint that does this that returns this and then we'll move that returns this and then we'll move that returns this and then we'll move forward from there this is what I do forward from there this is what I do forward from there this is what I do when I find myself in a situation when I find myself in a situation when I find myself in a situation when I'm working on a project with a team of I'm working on a project with a team of I'm working on a project with a team of people I take what they expect in a people I take what they expect in a people I take what they expect in a template and I return it from an API template and I return it from an API template and I return it from an API this way they can keep working and I can this way they can keep working and I can this way they can keep working and I can keep working too so let's do that I'm keep working too so let's do that I'm keep working too so let's do that I'm going to create a new function so I'm going to create a new function so I'm going to create a new function so I'm going to choose add add function and I going to choose add add function and I going to choose add add function and I can name this whatever I want and uh I can name this whatever I want and uh I can name this whatever I want and uh I suppose we should be clear right we're suppose we should be clear right we're suppose we should be clear right we're going to make an API we're actually going to make an API we're actually going to make an API we're actually going to make one so slash API and then going to make one so slash API and then going to make one so slash API and then I suppose we should probably say what I suppose we should probably say what I suppose we should probably say what it's going to be so we'll do a PIX API it's going to be so we'll do a PIX API it's going to be so we'll do a PIX API here right and I'm going to press enter and that and I'm going to press enter and that and I'm going to press enter and that will get me my boilerplate code uh of will get me my boilerplate code uh of will get me my boilerplate code uh of which I am going to get rid of which I am going to get rid of which I am going to get rid of everything so uh thank you for the help everything so uh thank you for the help everything so uh thank you for the help we're not actually returning twiml this time we're actually going to return an time we're actually going to return an time we're actually going to return an object and uh what I'll do is I'll copy object and uh what I'll do is I'll copy object and uh what I'll do is I'll copy the hardcoded array from this index file the hardcoded array from this index file the hardcoded array from this index file here I'll come in here and I'll copy here I'll come in here and I'll copy here I'll come in here and I'll copy this hardcoded now hardcoded means uh it this hardcoded now hardcoded means uh it this hardcoded now hardcoded means uh it is just like in the code this way right is just like in the code this way right is just like in the code this way right there's no way that this is going to be there's no way that this is going to be there's no way that this is going to be dynamic I'm going to change that uh here dynamic I'm going to change that uh here dynamic I'm going to change that uh here I'm going to paste that in here I'm going to paste that in here I'm going to paste that in here I'm going to name it the same thing so I'm going to name it the same thing so I'm going to name it the same thing so I'm going to create a new variable called going to create a new variable called going to create a new variable called gallery and I am going to just paste gallery and I am going to just paste gallery and I am going to just paste that hardcoded code there there we go that hardcoded code there there we go that hardcoded code there there we go and then I'm going to call this uh Gallery so again I have an array that's Gallery so again I have an array that's what this this bracket here is this what this this bracket here is this what this this bracket here is this array of these objects that's what these array of these objects that's what these array of these objects that's what these objects are these these uh uh mustaches objects are these these uh uh mustaches objects are these these uh uh mustaches they open up and the objects have these they open up and the objects have these they open up and the objects have these properties here and these are representing the picks that uh that plug-in requires and now I'm going to plug-in requires and now I'm going to plug-in requires and now I'm going to use this callback function to return that Gallery array one really nice thing that Gallery array one really nice thing that Gallery array one really nice thing about this toio function is that if I about this toio function is that if I about this toio function is that if I pass it an object like I did it'll pass it an object like I did it'll pass it an object like I did it'll automatically return Json to anybody who requests the URL so let's do that so I'm requests the URL so let's do that so I'm requests the URL so let's do that so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to save this going to go ahead I'm going to save this going to go ahead I'm going to save this and I'm going to deploy it now one thing to note by default it was now one thing to note by default it was actually protected that's what this little uh key lock thing means here so little uh key lock thing means here so little uh key lock thing means here so I'm going to click this and I'm going to click this and I'm going to click this and I'm going to change this to be public cuz we actually change this to be public cuz we actually change this to be public cuz we actually want anybody to be able to see it not want anybody to be able to see it not want anybody to be able to see it not just twilio um so this is this is what just twilio um so this is this is what just twilio um so this is this is what we're going to do I'm going to change we're going to do I'm going to change we're going to do I'm going to change this to be public and then I'm going to this to be public and then I'm going to this to be public and then I'm going to choose deploy all and you'll see that choose deploy all and you'll see that choose deploy all and you'll see that it's gray and when it's ready it will it's gray and when it's ready it will it's gray and when it's ready it will turn green for us um and so I want to go turn green for us um and so I want to go turn green for us um and so I want to go I'm going to copy this URL so I have I'm going to copy this URL so I have I'm going to copy this URL so I have this URL already and when it's green this URL already and when it's green this URL already and when it's green when this goes uh to be deployed so it's when this goes uh to be deployed so it's when this goes uh to be deployed so it's still deploying you can see it's deploying and you you'll know down here deploying and you you'll know down here deploying and you you'll know down here um when uh it'll say build completed and um when uh it'll say build completed and um when uh it'll say build completed and it will say deployed so it's deployed so it will say deployed so it's deployed so it will say deployed so it's deployed so I copied that URL I am going to go hit I copied that URL I am going to go hit I copied that URL I am going to go hit that URL and let's see what we get back that URL and let's see what we get back that URL and let's see what we get back awesome we got it so we got the the awesome we got it so we got the the awesome we got it so we got the the kitty descriptions and I blow this up a kitty descriptions and I blow this up a kitty descriptions and I blow this up a little bit here this is this is Json and little bit here this is this is Json and little bit here this is this is Json and automatically built this for us right it automatically built this for us right it automatically built this for us right it put the it's in the right format uh put the it's in the right format uh put the it's in the right format uh which is very nice in fact we could which is very nice in fact we could which is very nice in fact we could probably take this and why don't we probably take this and why don't we probably take this and why don't we we'll go over to uh the Thunder client we'll go over to uh the Thunder client we'll go over to uh the Thunder client and take a look at what's going on over and take a look at what's going on over and take a look at what's going on over there so I'm going to come back to my there so I'm going to come back to my there so I'm going to come back to my thunder client I'm going to make a new thunder client I'm going to make a new thunder client I'm going to make a new request and I'm going to hit to do a get request and I'm going to hit to do a get request and I'm going to hit to do a get to this this API that we just built and to this this API that we just built and to this this API that we just built and check it out it comes back it comes back check it out it comes back it comes back check it out it comes back it comes back with 200 okay and here's the the stuff with 200 okay and here's the the stuff with 200 okay and here's the the stuff that's coming back there's even some headers in here uh oh sorry some some if headers in here uh oh sorry some some if headers in here uh oh sorry some some if we look at the response we can look at we look at the response we can look at we look at the response we can look at the response headers over here and we the response headers over here and we the response headers over here and we can see uh that the the content type was can see uh that the the content type was can see uh that the the content type was set to application Json twily always sends back the shenanigans none which I love so now what we could do is we could love so now what we could do is we could love so now what we could do is we could give this URL to the team that's working give this URL to the team that's working give this URL to the team that's working on making the front end you know that on making the front end you know that on making the front end you know that that View application they could wire it that View application they could wire it that View application they could wire it up they could take this and as long as up they could take this and as long as up they could take this and as long as we match the same format and what we match the same format and what we match the same format and what we return that is as long as our API return that is as long as our API return that is as long as our API maintains the same contract everything should just work so that's pretty awesome right so let's move on to the awesome right so let's move on to the awesome right so let's move on to the next part I'm going to comment out uh next part I'm going to comment out uh next part I'm going to comment out uh this B so let's let's go ahead let's this B so let's let's go ahead let's this B so let's let's go ahead let's give it a uh we we're going to go ahead give it a uh we we're going to go ahead give it a uh we we're going to go ahead and make this an empty array right so and make this an empty array right so and make this an empty array right so that's how you make an empty array and that's how you make an empty array and that's how you make an empty array and I'm going to comment this out so that we I'm going to comment this out so that we I'm going to comment this out so that we have it so that we can kind of look at have it so that we can kind of look at have it so that we can kind of look at what the format is as we build stuff what the format is as we build stuff what the format is as we build stuff here so I'm going to comment that out here so I'm going to comment that out here so I'm going to comment that out and in fact I don't think I need uh the and in fact I don't think I need uh the and in fact I don't think I need uh the second one I'll just get that first one second one I'll just get that first one second one I'll just get that first one there get us some space there awesome so now let's use the text awesome so now let's use the text awesome so now let's use the text messages that were sent in our incoming messages that were sent in our incoming messages that were sent in our incoming messages so we're going to write some JavaScript code now if you aren't quite fluent yet code now if you aren't quite fluent yet code now if you aren't quite fluent yet in JavaScript remember that is okay and in JavaScript remember that is okay and in JavaScript remember that is okay and we've all been there and we all all of we've all been there and we all all of we've all been there and we all all of us I guarantee you everybody watching this understands that what you're going through can be challenging it's a new through can be challenging it's a new through can be challenging it's a new language I want you to try to follow language I want you to try to follow language I want you to try to follow along conceptually and I want you to along conceptually and I want you to along conceptually and I want you to take your time and I want you to take your time and I want you to take your time and I want you to take advantage of being in a video-based course this code that we are going to course this code that we are going to course this code that we are going to write will be available in the notes and write will be available in the notes and write will be available in the notes and I will walk us through it and then I'll I will walk us through it and then I'll I will walk us through it and then I'll go over it again translating it into the go over it again translating it into the go over it again translating it into the concepts that we've covered okay are you concepts that we've covered okay are you concepts that we've covered okay are you ready let's do this so twilio functions ready let's do this so twilio functions ready let's do this so twilio functions have another great feature I can get access to a rest feature I can get access to a rest client to the twilio rest client and client to the twilio rest client and client to the twilio rest client and authenticated a twilio rest client from the context object so context get twio the context object so context get twio the context object so context get twio client now remember that is uh going to client now remember that is uh going to client now remember that is uh going to be using my off token and my account sit be using my off token and my account sit be using my off token and my account sit and it's on this context it just and it's on this context it just and it's on this context it just automatically is authenticated which is really powerful cuz now I can get access really powerful cuz now I can get access really powerful cuz now I can get access to my thing because this function is to my thing because this function is to my thing because this function is running as me right so that's why it has running as me right so that's why it has running as me right so that's why it has access to that information so remember we want to get a hold of all of the we want to get a hold of all of the we want to get a hold of all of the messages that were sent in so we're messages that were sent in so we're messages that were sent in so we're going to use the API to do going to use the API to do going to use the API to do that um and remember we could have that um and remember we could have that um and remember we could have multiple phone numbers so I'm going to multiple phone numbers so I'm going to multiple phone numbers so I'm going to get the messages that were just sent to get the messages that were just sent to get the messages that were just sent to this phone number so I'm going to await this phone number so I'm going to await this phone number so I'm going to await cuz remember it returns a promise so cuz remember it returns a promise so cuz remember it returns a promise so client .,"['list', 'record', 'message',

when I share this code and now when I share this code and now when I share this code uh you won't need to do that you will uh you won't need to do that you will uh you won't need to do that you will need to set your environment variable though awesome so um and uh now what though awesome so um and uh now what though awesome so um and uh now what we've got to access to the well actually we've got to access to the well actually we've got to access to the well actually first we set a wait and we need to make first we set a wait and we need to make first we set a wait and we need to make sure that this function is marked a sync sure that this function is marked a sync sure that this function is marked a sync um so that that's required right in um so that that's required right in um so that that's required right in order to make this work so now it's order to make this work so now it's order to make this work so now it's going to get the messages it's going to get the messages it's going to get the messages it's going to return the messages and now we're going return the messages and now we're going return the messages and now we're going to Loop through those messages um one of to Loop through those messages um one of to Loop through those messages um one of my favorite ways of doing that is this my favorite ways of doing that is this my favorite ways of doing that is this four of loop so we're going to say four of loop so we're going to say four of loop so we're going to say four message of messages uh and for each one of those messages uh and for each one of those messages uh and for each one of those messages we're going to go through some things so we're going to go through some things so we're going to go through some things so um one thing you might not have thought um one thing you might not have thought um one thing you might not have thought about before is that when you send a about before is that when you send a about before is that when you send a message you can put multiple photos I I message you can put multiple photos I I message you can put multiple photos I I think typically Whenever I send when I think typically Whenever I send when I think typically Whenever I send when I just send one or then I send another just send one or then I send another just send one or then I send another message and another message you can actually add multiple pictures before you send it so um let me let's do that you send it so um let me let's do that you send it so um let me let's do that let's get a hold of all of the pictures let's get a hold of all of the pictures let's get a hold of all of the pictures that are available um so we'll say comp that are available um so we'll say comp that are available um so we'll say comp pix uh we'll call we'll call our pix uh we'll call we'll call our pix uh we'll call we'll call our variable called pix right uh for picture short for picture right uh for picture short for picture right uh for picture short for picture and we'll say await message now uh the and we'll say await message now uh the and we'll say await message now uh the message object that came back from this message object that came back from this message object that came back from this this API now we know that this was an this API now we know that this was an this API now we know that this was an API call but it is an object and that API call but it is an object and that API call but it is an object and that object actually has access to these sub object actually has access to these sub object actually has access to these sub resources which was media which we we we resources which was media which we we we resources which was media which we we we walked through this before remember there's the media URL and we grabbed there's the media URL and we grabbed there's the media URL and we grabbed that media URL we looked at all of them that media URL we looked at all of them that media URL we looked at all of them that were available this is basically doing that same thing and we're going to doing that same thing and we're going to doing that same thing and we're going to get all of the media that is available get all of the media that is available get all of the media that is available all right so we have that we have the all right so we have that we have the all right so we have that we have the message we have all of the pictures of message we have all of the pictures of message we have all of the pictures of that message and so for each of those that message and so for each of those that message and so for each of those pictures right so each of the pictures we need to actually need to pictures we need to actually need to pictures we need to actually need to declare the variable just to be better declare the variable just to be better declare the variable just to be better there so we'll say for const pick of there so we'll say for const pick of there so we'll say for const pick of picks right so we're going to make a new picks right so we're going to make a new picks right so we're going to make a new variable called pick looping through each one of these that came back from each one of these that came back from each one of these that came back from from this array right so so um for all from this array right so so um for all from this array right so so um for all of the the messages for all of the the messages for all of the the messages for all of the pictures in the messages now what we're pictures in the messages now what we're pictures in the messages now what we're going to do is we're going to add that going to do is we're going to add that going to do is we're going to add that to this Gallery so this is an empty to this Gallery so this is an empty to this Gallery so this is an empty array but we're going to dynamically add array but we're going to dynamically add array but we're going to dynamically add to it and the way that you add to an to it and the way that

again this is passed in and the twio number is set in passed in and the twio number is set in passed in and the twio number is set in my environment variables over here so we're say because because you could have we're say because because you could have we're say because because you could have multiple right you could have multiple twilio phone numbers so we want to say twilio phone numbers so we want to say twilio phone numbers so we want to say only the ones that were sent to so we're only the ones that were sent to so we're only the ones that were sent to so we're very we're being be

property called media which lets us get to a sub resource and you remember in to a sub resource and you remember in to a sub resource and you remember in the Json uh there was a there's a link the Json uh there was a there's a link the Json uh there was a there's a link to this and we could go and query this to this and we could go and query this to this and we could go and query this ourselves but we don't need to because ourselves but we don't need to because ourselves but we don't need to because the API has wrapped that for us it's the API has wrapped that for us it's the API has wrapped that for us it's very nice it's nice abstraction and we're we're going to get the list of we're we're going to get the list of we're we're going to get the list of those picks and again this is

this code is man and what we did with this code is actually pretty common now in an app actually pretty common now in an app actually pretty common now in an app like the one that we're building probably eventually what you're going to do is you're going to store those photos do is you're going to store those photos do is you're going to store those photos that were submitted into a database right and you're going to do that from right and you're going to do that from right and you're going to do that from this incoming message function you're going to get it you're going to store it going to get it you're going to store it going to get it you're going to store it if it's valid if it's it's a valid if it's valid if it's it's a valid if it's valid if it's it's a valid picture you don't want to show pictures picture you don't want to show pictures picture you don't want to show pictures that aren't you're going to store it in that aren't you're going to store it in that aren't you're going to store it in a database and then you're going to a database and then you're going to a database and then you're going to format it uh for whatever your client is format it uh for whatever your client is format it uh for whatever your client is you're going to get that from a database you're going to get that from a database you're going to get that from a database so maybe instead of coming back from so maybe instead of coming back from so maybe instead of coming back from this API you're going to come from a this API you're going to come from a this API you're going to come from a database API and you're going to pull database API and you're going to pull database API and you're going to pull back uh your information and then you're back uh your information and then you're back uh your information and then you're going to push it through and that going to push it through and that going to push it through and that database is going to be in its own database is going to be in its own database is going to be in its own format but you're going to make it match format but you're going to make it match format but you're going to make it match whatever it is that you are trying to whatever it is that you are trying to whatever it is that you are trying to push out there you're not GNA it's not push out there you're not GNA it's not push out there you're not GNA it's not going to look exactly like the message going to look exactly like the message going to look exactly like the message right I'm not going to send back uh one right I'm not going to send back uh one right I'm not going to send back uh one of these messages and make my API look of these messages and make my API look of these messages and make my API look like that I'm going to shape the data like that I'm going to shape the data like that I'm going to shape the data that's what that's called I'm going to that's what that's called I'm going to that's what that's called I'm going to shape my data in the way that I want it shape my data in the way that I want it shape my data in the way that I want it to be used and we came with the spec to be used and we came with the spec to be used and we came with the spec this is the shape of the data so we took this is the shape of the data so we took this is the shape of the data so we took the data and we shaped it we formed it the data and we shaped it we formed it the data and we shaped it we formed it into what uh was expected all these into what uh was expected all these into what uh was expected all these burritos are making me hungry I think burritos are making me hungry I think burritos are making me hungry I think I'm going to go fetch one from my I'm going to go fetch one from my I'm going to go fetch one from my favorite takaria I'll make sure to snap favorite takaria I'll make sure to snap favorite takaria I'll make sure to snap a pick you should get one too actually a pick you should get one too actually a pick you should get one too actually you deserve it you deserve a burrito and you deserve it you deserve a burrito and you deserve it you deserve a burrito and when we get back we'll look at how to when we get back we'll look at how to when we get back we'll look at how to fetch this data that we just generated fetch this data that we just generated fetch this data that we just generated in our client app so we've coded our in our client app so we've coded our in our client app so we've coded our external public API and it's ready to be external public API and it's ready to be external public API and it's ready to be consumed now our API uses an external consumed now our API uses an external consumed now our API uses an external API twilio and we're going to need to API twilio and we're going to need to API twilio and we're going to need to use our web framework views API to use our web framework views API to use our web framework views API to retrieve the data and to do that we're retrieve the data and to do that we're retrieve the data and to do that we're going to need to use the web API fetch going to need to use the web API fetch going to need to use the web API fetch see apis are everywhere no wonder you see apis are everywhere no wonder you see apis are everywhere no wonder you came looking for this course all right came looking for this course all right came looking for this course all right let's make use of our server-based API let's make use of our server-based API let's make use of our server-based API in our client side application all right in our client side application all right in our client side application all right so just like I just consumed my burrito so just like I just consumed my burrito so just like I just consumed my burrito we are going to consume that API that we are going to consume that API that we are going to consume that API that we just created so if I scroll down here just created so if I scroll down here just created so if I scroll down here remember we're passing in this Gallery here um and we scroll down here into here um and we scroll down here into here um and we scroll down here into this load images and this load images and this load images and this load images gets kicked off uh from the API of uh gets kicked off uh from the API of uh gets kicked off uh from the API of uh Vue right so Vue has these life cycle Vue right so Vue has these life cycle Vue right so Vue has these life cycle apis and when the the thing's mounted apis and when the the thing's mounted apis and when the the thing's mounted it's going to call this load images it's going to call this load images it's going to call this load images we're going to come into load images and we're going to come into load images and we're going to come into load images and now we have some to-dos that we have now we have some to-dos that we have now we have some to-dos that we have already to done so we are going to use already to done so we are going to use already to done so we are going to use the messaging API to use submitted photos we did that we did that in our photos we did that we did that in our photos we did that we did that in our API and then we are going to create a API and then we are going to create a API and then we are going to create a web- based API that matches this expected response we also did that didn't we we did that so let's get rid didn't we we did that so let's get rid didn't we we did that so let's get rid of that all right so here we go so this of that all right so here we go so this of that all right so here we go so this got a suggestion here of what to start got a suggestion here of what to start got a suggestion here of what to start uh doing here so I'm going to uncomment uh doing here so I'm going to uncomment uh doing here so I'm going to uncomment this so uh we're going to create a new this so uh we're going to create a new this so uh we're going to create a new uh response object and we are going to uh response object and we are going to uh response object and we are going to await and we are going to use Fetch and await and we are going to use Fetch and await and we are going to use Fetch and fetch here is part of the web API that fetch here is part of the web API that fetch here is part of the web API that browsers must Implement um to do exactly browsers must Implement um to do exactly browsers must Implement um to do exactly what we're trying to do right we want to what we're trying to do right we want to what we're trying to do right we want to fetch data from our API now this happens fetch data from our API now this happens fetch data from our API now this happens to be on the same server so we can use a to be on the same server so we can use a to be on the same server so we can use a relative link like this/ API here um we relative link like this/ API here um we relative link like this/ API here um we don't need to specify the server right don't need to specify the server right don't need to specify the server right it's assumed so uh our API we we called that assumed so uh our API we we called that assumed so uh our API we we called that right we called it API SLP so SLP is right we called it API SLP so SLP is right we called it API SLP so SLP is what we are going to hit there um and what we are going to hit there um and what we are going to hit there um and you notice that it's using await because you notice that it's using await because you notice that it's using await because this is an async function so fetch this is an async function so fetch this is an async function so fetch returns a promise and it's going to returns a promise and it's going to returns a promise and it's going to return that response and uh that response has a a response and uh that response has a a response and uh that response has a a method on it called Json um that will method on it called Json um that will method on it called Json um that will actually return the Json representation of whatever came back so what I'm going of whatever came back so what I'm going of whatever came back so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of this to do is I'm going to get rid of this to do is I'm going to get rid of this Gallery this hardcoded gallery that is gone and I am going to say await we are gone and I am going to say await we are gone and I am going to say await we are going to await because this method is going to await because this method is going to await because this method is also asynchronous response.,"['body',

this in this response that came back this response has all sorts of uh metadata response has all sorts of uh metadata response has all sorts of uh metadata about it but we just want to get the about

because our API is Json enabled Json and because our API is Json enabled Json and because our API is Json enabled it's just going to come out all right let's deploy it I cannot stop oops this says not it I cannot stop oops this says not it I cannot stop oops this says not unable to deploy because I didn't save unable to deploy because I didn't save unable to deploy because I didn't save it so I need to save it first I cannot it so I need to save it first I cannot it so I need to save it first I cannot stop thinking about that bro it was so stop thinking about that bro it was so stop thinking about that bro it was so good I submitted a selfie of myself and good I submitted a selfie of myself and good I submitted a selfie of myself and I texted it to my twilio number and I texted it to my twilio number and I texted it to my twilio number and I got a reply back from my twio trial got a reply back from my twio trial got a reply back from my twio trial account right and it says uh thanks for account right and it says uh thanks for account right and it says uh thanks for submitting it so if all goes well when submitting it so if all goes well when submitting it so if all goes well when we look here I'll be able to show you we look here I'll be able to show you we look here I'll be able to show you the burrito that I texted to my number the burrito that I texted to my number the burrito that I texted to my number um so uh it's been deployed and I'm um so uh it's been deployed and I'm um so uh it's been deployed and I'm going to come in here under this uh going to come in here

this gallery and here it is look at the this gallery and here it is look at the this gallery and here it is look at the size of this thing it was truly bigger size of this thing it was truly bigger size of this thing it was truly bigger than my head so if we click that uh we than my head so if we click that uh we than my head so if we click that uh we can go we can see my other uh beautiful can go we can see my other uh beautiful can go we can see my other uh beautiful burrito uh there as well now let's look again back here at well now let's look again back here at well now let's look again back here at the client side of things and just take the client side of things and just take the client side of things and just take a look at how beautiful this is it's a look at how beautiful this is it's a look at how beautiful this is it's just two lines and it's hitting our apis just two lines and it's hitting our apis just two lines and it's hitting our apis and that's the power of this API we were and that's the power of this API we were and that's the power of this API we were able to hit an API and get User able to hit an API and get User able to hit an API and get User submitted text messages text photos right and it only took lines and really right and it only took lines and really right and it only took lines and really it only took one line actually you know it only took one line actually you know it only took one line actually you know like if we we could have like chained like if we we could have like chained like if we we could have like chained some stuff on top of this awesome now some stuff on top of this awesome now some stuff on top of this awesome now one thing that I do want to note is that one thing that I do want to note is that one thing that I do want to note is that there's no authentication at all to this there's no authentication at all to this there's no authentication at all to this API right I could I didn't uh Supply any API right I could I didn't uh Supply any API right I could I didn't uh Supply any authentication information at all it's open to everyone and that's kind of a open to everyone and that's kind of a open to everyone and that's kind of a good thing if you are working on a good thing if you are working on a good thing if you are working on a client side application you don't want to pass your keys around like I would to pass your keys around like I would to pass your keys around like I would not want to put my my twilio keys here not want to put my my twilio keys here not want to put my my twilio keys here on this page because I don't know if you on this page because I don't know if you on this page because I don't know if you know this but you can actually see know this but you can actually see know this but you can actually see everything that that comes down so I'm everything that that comes down so I'm everything that that comes down so I'm going to view the source of this and you going to view the source of this and you going to view the source of this and you can see here's the source that we're can see here's the source that we're can see here's the source that we're looking at and if I had used any sort of looking at and if I had used any sort of looking at and if I had used any sort of API keys I would see them right here you API keys I would see them right here you API keys I would see them right here you don't want to leak your keys that way don't want to leak your keys that way don't want to leak your keys that way check the notes for more information on check the notes for more information on check the notes for more information on how to get around this but typically how to get around this but typically how to get around this but typically this is what you do is you write a this is what you do is you write a this is what you do is you write a server that then the server keeps track server that then the server keeps track server that then the server keeps track of all the keys and you connect to the of all the keys and you connect to the of all the keys and you connect to the server but if you do need to provide server but if you do need to provide server but if you do need to provide some authentication locally on the client there are ways to do that check client there are ways to do that check client there are ways to do that check the notes but look at this look at this the notes but look at this look at this the notes but look at this look at this you did this you have designed a new you did this you have designed a new you did this you have designed a new interface a text messaging interface right A A A TMI W I hope this wasn't TMI or also TMI W I hope this wasn't TMI or also TMI W I hope this wasn't TMI or also known as too much information for you known as too much information for you known as too much information for you you learned a whole lot about apis and you learned a whole lot about apis and you learned a whole lot about apis and not just the web-based ones you saw them not just the web-based ones you saw them not just the web-based ones you saw them in practice and you even built your own in practice and you even built your own in practice and you even built your own one you really deserved that burrito awesome job you've just built and consumed your own API now here's my consumed your own API now here's my consumed your own API now here's my question to you do you think that the question to you do you think that the question to you do you think that the API I code that we wrote together should API I code that we wrote together should API I code that we wrote together should be considered restful why don't we take be considered restful why don't we take be considered restful why don't we take a look at our weathered scavenger hunt a look at our weathered scavenger hunt a look at our weathered scavenger hunt card so it's definitely a client server card so it's definitely a client server card so it's definitely a client server architecture our client happens to be in architecture our client happens to be in architecture our client happens to be in this case A View application running in this case A View application running in this case A View application running in the browser and our server is a the browser and our server is a the browser and our server is a serverless node application but any client could connect and use this statelessness it's definitely stateless right we aren't requiring any prior knowledge about the client cach ability H well at the moment client cach ability H well at the moment client cach ability H well at the moment we aren't providing any caching information though we could right we could fairly easily pay attention to those headers coming in and we could those headers coming in and we could those headers coming in and we could respond appropriately it would require us writing some additional code and thinking through some of the edge cases thinking through some of the edge cases thinking through some of the edge cases but we could do it let's put that in the but we could do it let's put that in the but we could do it let's put that in the maybe column layered system yeah for sure right in fact it's a little layered sure right in fact it's a little layered sure right in fact it's a little layered already our API is calling another API already our API is calling another API already our API is calling another API but our client doesn't need to know that but our client doesn't need to know that but our client doesn't need to know that we could also add additional functionality and the contract wouldn't change code on demand we haven't even change code on demand we haven't even change code on demand we haven't even talked about this one yet and it's the talked about this one yet and it's the talked about this one yet and it's the only optional requirement basically this means that your API returns code that is means that your API returns code that is means that your API returns code that is runnable like maybe it returns an embeddable widget or some actual JavaScript code this doesn't make any sense in our use case and that's totally sense in our use case and that's totally sense in our use case and that's totally okay so we're going to drop this one okay so we're going to drop this one okay so we're going to drop this one into the no column so we're looking good into the no column so we're looking good into the no column so we're looking good so far but here comes the doozy uniform so far but here comes the doozy uniform so far but here comes the doozy uniform interface so remember this one has four interface so remember this one has four interface so remember this one has four subsections resource identification and requests r r currently we're just presenting all the messages as objects and absolutely no way to identify them and absolutely no way to identify them and absolutely no way to identify them so we fail this sub requirement and so we fail this sub requirement and so we fail this sub requirement and therefore this is a no but let's keep therefore this is a no but let's keep therefore this is a no but let's keep going through the rest of these pun going through the rest of these pun going through the rest of these pun intended sorry resource manipulation through representations we definitely do not allow any sort of manipulation of not allow any sort of manipulation of not allow any sort of manipulation of the images so this is another fail the images so this is another fail the images so this is another fail self-descriptive messages we haven't gone over this yet but by using headers gone over this yet but by using headers gone over this yet but by using headers we can tell that this is Json the we can tell that this is Json the we can tell that this is Json the message sent down has a type and it's message sent down has a type and it's message sent down has a type and it's clear that that it should be Json clear that that it should be Json clear that that it should be Json decoded to be used hyper media as the decoded to be used hyper media as the decoded to be used hyper media as the engine of application State and last but engine of application State and last but engine of application State and last but certainly not least hat Os or hate o certainly not least hat Os or hate o certainly not least hat Os or hate o it's an often forgot about part of the it's an often forgot about part of the it's an often forgot about part of the restful constraint and the idea here is restful constraint and the idea here is restful constraint and the idea here is that there are links to show off what that there are links to show off what that there are links to show off what more you could do with this and where more you could do with this and where more you could do with this and where you could find related resources it provides uis or links and we did see provides uis or links and we did see provides uis or links and we did see this in both the Spotify and twio ones this in both the Spotify and twio ones this in both the Spotify and twio ones however ours doesn't provide links to other resources so we don't have a other resources so we don't have a other resources so we don't have a restful API and that's okay it's going restful API and that's okay it's going restful API and that's okay it's going to suit our needs it does look like we to suit our needs it does look like we to suit our needs it does look like we could get there pretty quickly if we could get there pretty quickly if we could get there pretty quickly if we wanted to one thing I want you to gain wanted to one thing I want you to gain wanted to one thing I want you to gain from that exercise though is that you from that exercise though is that you from that exercise though is that you now have the ability to identify whether now have the ability to identify whether now have the ability to identify whether or not an API is restful and I hope that or not an API is restful and I hope that or not an API is restful and I hope that felt pretty good we've now completed the felt pretty good we've now completed the felt pretty good we've now completed the scavenger hunt we revealed all the constraints and I hope most of those are constraints and I hope most of those are constraints and I hope most of those are pretty clear please don't feel like you pretty clear please don't feel like you pretty clear please don't feel like you need to memorize those you can find need to memorize those you can find need to memorize those you can find those same constraints littered all over the internet now as a prize for the internet now as a prize for the internet now as a prize for finishing the constraint scavenger hunt I've dropped links to my favorite rest I've dropped links to my favorite rest I've dropped links to my favorite rest API constraint documentation for you to lean on should you need to I've also lean on should you need to I've also lean on should you need to I've also included links to the popular rest API included links to the popular rest API included links to the popular rest API Frameworks that will help you design restful apis make sure to check out the restful apis make sure to check out the restful apis make sure to check out the notes you did it you just completed a notes you did it you just completed a notes you did it you just completed a whirlwind introduction to apis and I hope that you can see how much more hope that you can see how much more hope that you can see how much more power they can add to your programming power they can add to your programming power they can add to your programming journey by looking at interfaces in general I hope you're more comfortable with the idea of not fully understanding with the idea of not fully understanding with the idea of not fully understanding exactly how something is working but still leaning on that abstraction to build your tools and applications do this all the time with physical object this all the time with physical object this all the time with physical object interfaces and apis or application programming interfaces they aren't all that different I hope you enjoyed taking that different I hope you enjoyed taking that different I hope you enjoyed taking this course I know I had a lot of fun this course I know I had a lot of fun this course I know I had a lot of fun making it if you think someone you know making it if you think someone you know making it if you think someone you know might benefit from this course please share it with them I'd love to hear your share it with them I'd love to hear your share it with them I'd love to hear your feelings your thoughts your dreams so I feelings your thoughts your dreams so I feelings your thoughts your dreams so I threw together a little something using a smattering of apis to capture your a smattering of apis to capture your a smattering of apis to capture your feedback if you've got the time I'd love feedback if you've got the time I'd love feedback if you've got the time I'd love to have you answer a quick text based to have you answer a quick text based to have you answer a quick text based survey text feedback to the number on survey text feedback to the number on survey text feedback to the number on your screen well actually you know what your screen well actually you know what your screen well actually you know what if you want you can also call and just if you want you can also call and just if you want you can also call and just leave me a message too I use an API for leave me a message too I use an API for leave me a message too I use an API for that too so please please please keep me that too so please please please keep me that too so please please please keep me posted on your journey and really I posted on your journey and really I posted on your journey and really I can't wait to see what you build thanks can't wait to see what you build thanks can't wait to see what you build thanks again
